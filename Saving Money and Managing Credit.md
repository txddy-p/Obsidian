- `Capital`: 
	- Invested - earns interest income
	- Borrowed - incurs interest expense
- `Term`: Period for which investment made or period before loan is repaid.
- `Instalment`: Periodic payments required over period to pay off loans. (periodic payments help the cashflow of the individual because it's smaller amounts as opposed to a big payment)
##### Interest and interest rates: 
- Compensation to lender, Cost to the borrower
- Fixed and floating (variable)
		- A fixed interest rate stays the same throughout the term of the loan (or deposit in the case of savings). 
		- Floating interest rates are more unpredictable, and can change both up and down throughout the term of the loan or deposit. Floating interest rates are based on some reference rate, which in South Africa is normally the repo(repurchase) rate. 
- The repo rate (set by SARB), is the rate at which it lends to commercial banks. This rate, which is reconsidered quarterly, is  related to inflation and inflationary expectations.
- The prime rate (current in South Africa is 11.75%),
# Savings
There are many savings vehicles available, including bank deposits, money market funds,
unit trusts and the repayment of debts (especially mortgages).
### Reasons for saving
- `Retirement investing`. One of the main reasons for saving is to ensure a reasonable standard of living later in life, when there is either no longer a will or an ability to earn an active income.
- `Emergencies and peace of mind`. One of the biggest areas of stress in many households is finances. Having some extra savings stashed away somewhere can have a huge impact on reducing this stress, and the fear of not being able to deal with unforeseen expenses such as serious car problems or, in more serious cases, reduced or loss of income.
- `Saving on interest`. Savings are the opposite of debt. The more you save, the more you reduce debt, and therefore your interest bill.
- `For the big purchase`. Often there are things we really want to do or buy, but cannot afford. It is often easier to purchase many smaller things over a long time than to buy very little while saving up for a bigger purchase.
- `Savings on purchases`. Purchases are generally cheaper if paid for in cash. In some cases, significant discounts are given for cash payment. It is handy to have a bit of money saved away for when such an opportunity comes along.
### Good savings habits
- `Start early`. One of the most basic savings truths is that it is critical to start as early as possible. Because of the effect of compounding, this habit has an enormous effect on the end result.
- `A little every month`. It is usually easier to save small amounts every month rather than a single big amount, and yet this could achieve exactly the same end result.
-  `Automate the savings process`. One way of making savings easier is to automate the savings process, so that the saver does not have to actively initiate savings on an ongoing basis. 
- `Consider every purchase carefully`. Every purchase is a sacrifice of potential savings. Therefore, it is useful to think of every purchase as a decision not to save. Once an individual has this mindset, it becomes easier to be more disciplined when spending.
- `Do not let income determine spending`. It is human nature to spend more when income increases, which in economics is known as the marginal propensity to consume. However, if income is allowed to be the only factor that determines spending, savings will never be considered as an alternative option. 
- `Consider the returns`. If your savings earn less than the rate of inflation, then your money is actually losing value. A key habit of saving therefore is to make sure that your savings are earning as much as possible given your personal circumstances. 
# Debt and credit
- The worst reason for borrowing is to spend on short-term things that soon lose their value, such as holidays or clothing. 
#### Bad reasons
- `Matching maturities`
- `Spend on short term items that lose value quickly`
- `Keeping up with Jones / neighbours`
##### Consequencies of excessive debt
- `A bad credit record`: Once a person starts to fall behind on debt repayments, he or she starts to build up a bad credit record, which means that future credit becomes very difficult to obtain. 
-  `Loss of possessions`
- `Household stress and conflict`: Financial stress as a result of excessive indebtedness is one of the foremost causes of divorce and the breakup of families.
#### Good Reasons
- To purchase a life long assets - essential e.g. house and vehicles?
	- Applying Matching
- To make a high return investment. Better be sure of returns!
- To fund education: worth borrowing to educate oneself earlier than later
- To take advantage of an opportunity: painting, borrow and repay the loan and end with a nice profit
	- Never borrow to speculate
- As bridging finance
- In emergencies
## Financial leverage
The concept of financial leverage (also known as “financial gearing”) refers to the use of at least some debt to buy an asset in order to increase potential returns. However, leverage also increases the risk of such an investment. In the context of personal finance, the most common use of leverage is in purchasing fixed property
- Financial leverage improves positive returns when things go well and also worsens the negative return when things don't go well
# The four “Cs” of credit
#### Capacity
- Enough future sustainable income to satisfy interest and capital repayments. (3 payslips & 3 Bank statements)
- Nature of income, employer & employment contract
- Permanent better chances: hence growth rate in unsecured lending
#### Capital
- Lender also interested in the Equity of the borrower and extent of debt
	- Remember A = E + L
	- Evaluate the quality & liquidity (conversion to cash) of assets
#### Collateral (security) quality and type
- Surety very risky
#### Character
- Borrower has moral, ethical intention to pay back interest & loan amount
- His / her Credit history will provide some indication
- If the bank has a long credit history with you – more confident to approve / grant loan
- Credit references relating to past debt
- Common sense / financial condition 
## Types of Credit Structures
1. `Non-instalment credit`. Lump-sum repayment.
2. `Instalment credit`. Lender retains ownership of financed goods until final payment is made
3. `Revolving credit`. 
	- Common example is a credit card
	- Maximum (credit limit)
	- Must stay within credit limit and make regular payments on the account.
	- Annual (monthly fee) interest on overdue accounts
## Different forms of Credit
##### Credit cards
- Issued by banks and revolving credit
- Pre-approved loan
- Used at stores to make purchases and stores are charged 5 % commission on each transaction by banks
	- Bank pays stores and then recovers money from customer
- Two costs involved:
	- Annual fees & interest on credit card purchases
	- Benefits (special discounts from certain merchants)
- Differentiation of credit cards: various benefits such reduced plane tickets prices, gym membership fees.
- Methods of repayment:
	- Straight – next month
	- Budget - 6 to 48 months
##### Store cards
- Issued by various stores
- Very expensive
	- (I saw this in a clothing store 1.9% per month = 1.9 x 12 =22,8 % per year)
- Risks of card: as people tend to spend more than usual, plastic generation;
	- Especially as stores extend and increase credit limits when more regular payments are made.
##### Bank overdrafts
Overdrafts are linked to cheque accounts held with banks, and allow the holder of a cheque
account to withdraw more money from the account than is in it (in other words, to have a
negative balance on the account). Naturally, overdrafts are not free – you will pay interest
on the negative balance in the account, and typically also an overdraft fee. Banks will often
grant overdrafts without the account holder applying for it. The maximum (or overdraft
limit) is based on your credit profile. Overdrafts are the most common and useful forms of
bridging finance, but like credit cards they are risky in that they make it easy to go into debt
without thinking
##### Personal loans (Secured & unsecured)
- Banks normally would like to know what the money is used for.
- Fixed monthly income & good credit history
- Period is normally 6 to 60 months
- Interest rate is usually higher than prime rate (currently at 9%)
##### Motor vehicle finance
- Hire purchase agreement
- Instalments over 48 to 60 months and includes both capital and interest
- Insurance, maintenance & all operating expenses paid by borrower
- Balloon payment (residual) at the end of the hire purchase period to obtain legal ownership locks the purchaser in debt
##### Home loans (Mortgages)
- Large loan to purchase property (20 years)
- Amortising loans
	- Payments are part capital and interest. The interest will progressively decrease as the principal sum decreases.
# Debt Calculations
$$
C = \frac{PVA \times r}{1 - \left [ \frac{1}{(1+r)^t} \right ]}
$$
$$
C = \frac{PVA \times \frac{i}{m}}{1 - \left [ {(1+\frac{i}{m})^{-n \times m}} \right ]}
$$
##### Link between term and monthly payment
- Lower instalment over longer period;
- Cost associated to paying over a longer period;
- Longer the payment period higher the interest expense;
- Watch out for increasing interest rates and other cost of living increases.
##### The impact of loan amount
There are thus two reasons to save up for a deposit: 
- it reduces the monthly repayment, which allows you to buy at a higher price, 
- and it reduces the overall interest paid. 
###### Deposit benefits:
- Reduces monthly repayment
- Reduces overall interest
##### The real cost of debt
Although the idea of not paying any instalments for the first year seems appealing to many people, the problem is that this has to be made up for with higher payments later on. 
##### Amortising loans
An amortising loan is a loan in which both capital and interest are paid off in each instalment. Interest is calculated on the reduced remaining capital after each payment.
Mortgages are a good example of this type of loan.
PVA  = R100 000 Loan
i/m   = 10% = 10%/2 = 5%
nxm  = 4x2 = 8 periods
![[amortising_loan.png]]
- Instalment (C) remains constant.
- The balance (E) is decreasing so does the interest (B) .
- The capital repayment (D) increases.
##### Debt to income ratios
- The `debt to income ratio` is the `ratio of the payments made every month towards debt` (capital and interest payments) `divided by` `total monthly income`.
- A related ratio is the `debt to disposable income`, which measures the percentage of income after the necessities have been paid that is spent on debt servicing. 
$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\text{Payments towards debt}}{\text{Total monthly income}} \hspace{25mm}
 \frac{\text{Debt}}{\text{Disposable income}}
\end{align}
$$
- Above 35 % is very risky.
- An increase in either ratio is indicative of increased financial risk (Interest and capital repayments).
- A Debt to income ratio of 84% for example means that 84% of an individual's disposable income pays debt and they are only left with 16% to spend on other things, like emergencies. 
#### The role of a credit record and credit score
An individual’s CREDIT SCORE is made up of the following 5 criteria:
1. Individual’s historical payment history
	- Consistent & timely payments of accounts and loan instalments
2. Amount of available credit used
	- Using credit responsibly improves credit score
3. Length of individual’s credit history: financial reliability
	- Start small, etc cell phone contracts.
	- The longer the better
4. Types of credits being utilised
	- Mix is preferred as indicative of how well credit is managed
5. Credit bureaus: Frequency of enquiries into your credit record
	- If it is high implies that you may be applying for new credit to meet existing debt. It says individual is in “financial distress”. 
#### Good and bad credit habits
1. Not reading the credit terms: Tata cars
	- Clients would get a monthly cash refund if they drove 2 000 kms a month.
	- It ended when fewer people bought TATA cars.
2. Not determining what the debt really costs
	- Again does the credit provider have a moral obligation to explain this?
3. Having an excessive number of credit cards: No financial discipline
4. Skipping payments: Poor planning & not conscious of financial affairs
5. Using debts to pay other debts
6. Not paying off debt as quickly as possible
	- Interest savings is big. Think of the compounding effect!
#### Actions to improve a bad debt situation
1. Admit the problem - denial is bad
2. Determine what the reason/s are: be bold and honest
3. Reduce expenses: especially non essential items
4. Finding additional sources of income: Busking ? Tutor? Weekend job?
5. Re-negotiate payment terms with creditors:
	- Lower payments & extended period (See Case study 1 on slides 18 to 20)
	- It seems the consumer never wins!
6. Consolidate debts: All debt into one big loan
	- Normally happens when people go for debt review.
		- They also have to pay the costs of the debt counsellor and his staff.
	- Advantages: Longer term and affordable
	- Disadvantages: Longer term and increased interest costs
