# Introduction: What is the law?
- Rules of law and other rules:
	- Various rules and norms regulate human behaviour
	- At a basic level, four types of conduct rules:
		1. Rules of religion
		2. Rules of individual morality
		3. Rules of collective morality
		4. Rules of law
- What is the rule of law?
- Rules and norms often overlap: Eg, A murders B: what basic conduct rules are implicated here?
- The role of the law within the engineering profession
	- Ethics
	- Labour relations
	- Legal structures to carry on a business & corporate governance
	- Contracts
	- Intellectual property
	- Risk management
	- Dispute resolution
- Is the law fair or just, and should it be?
	- Must legal rules be fair (reasonable) and just for it to have legal effect?
	- Positive law vs natural law
	- How do we determine whether a rule of law is just?
## Classification of the law
- Substantive v procedural law?
- Substantive law
	- Comprises legal principles
		- EG it is a criminal offence to commit murder
- Procedural law
	- Comprises procedural principles & requirements
		- EG you must reply to a pleading (a document that needs to be submitted during court proceedings) within 10 days
- __Public law__ is the law that exists between the state and its subject (ie the government & us!)
- __Private law__ is the law that exists between persons or which deals with persons alone
- __Commercial__ law to some extent is a combination of these two (above types of law) but it is also law of relevance to commerce, trade and industry
- Note:
	- There are overlaps between various categories
	- Previous slide is not a closed list - other areas of the law exist too
Classification of law
- The role of different types of law and what it aims to regulate:

## Sources of South African law
1. The Constitution and legislation
2. Common law
3. Custom
4. Indigenous law
5. Court decisions/case law
### The role of the Constitution
- Supreme law and all other laws/actions/policies must comply with it
- Regulates the structure of the state, including:
	- Parliament
	- National Council of Provinces
	- President & Executive
	- Provincial legislatures
	- Local government
	- The courts
	- Chapter 9 institutions (Public Protector, SAHRC, Auditor General, Electoral Commission)
	- Public administration
	- Security services
	- Traditional leaders
	- Finance
- It also regulates the role and status of International law in South Africa
- Importantly, it includes the Bill of Rights
### Legislation
- Refers to statutes, acts, regulations etc.
- Types of legislation
- The Constitution
- Parliamentary legislation (national legislation)
- Provincial legislation (e,g, provincial regulations)
- Subordinate legislation (Local level and other)
#### What is legislation?
- These are written laws passed by national / provincial / municipal government
- They bind everyone / specific groups within the population (eg creditors & debtors)
- Legislation can change existing law (eg common law principles)
- Designed to:
	- fill gaps & loopholes
	- update existing law
	- engage in social engineering
	- ensure legal protection
	- promote legal certainty & provide clarity
#### Where do we find legislation?
- Statutes are published in Government Gazettes
- LexisNexis, Juta & Sabinet have electronic versions of all statutes
- You can search:
	- by title (eg Labour Relations Act)
	- by Year (eg Act 66 of 1995) OR
	- by category (eg Employment / labour law)
#### How is legislation applied/enforced?
- Criminal law – enforced by police, public prosecutors & the courts
- Administrative law – courts & tribunals & criminal prosecution
- Civil law – litigation/arbitration by individuals (courts and other bodies)
- Chapter 9 Institutions – eg Public Protector
### Common law
- Not a codified system
- Roman Dutch law & English law through precedent = influenced SA law
- Applies where there is no specific legislation
- Can be ‘abrogated by disuse’ – eg crime of adultery
- Section 39(2) of Constitution – duty on courts to develop the common law (in line with the constitution & Bill of rights)
- The common law may also be amended by legislation
- Is the common law still relevant today?
- Many principles of common law are long standing and remain applicable despite legislation.
- One example is the locatio conductio operarum, a contract for rendering of personal services.
	- Employee subordinate to the will of employer.
	- Obliged to obey lawful instructions.
	- Deference, good faith, honesty and trust
- *BUT particularly in the labour law context, legislation has made substantial changes to the law
	- Eg. Fairness mechanisms
### Law of customs
- Long standing, established practices within specific communities
- Derived from the customs of society which are carried through from one generation to another.
- Usually unwritten
- Van Breda v Jacobs 1921 AD 330 ruled that a custom could be a source of law if it meets the following 4 requirements:
	- In use for a long time
	- It must be fair/reasonable
	- Certain & clear content
	- Generally recognised and faithfully observed by society
### Indigenous law
- Unwritten customary law which applies to many African communities in SA
- Today, it is applied in the ordinary courts in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws
- Once proven, it enjoys the status of common law
- Proof of indigenous law often requires expert evidence
- What if custom/customary law is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights/Constitution?
	- Eg customary rule of succession - male primogeniture
	- This led to the Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act 11 of 2009
- Ultimately, it is about developing customary law (or other laws) to ensure that it is consistent with the Constitution
	- This may happen through legislation (but there are other routes too)
### Court decisions/case law
- Not strictly a source of law but rather a statement of the law.
- Judges do not create law, they interpret it
- Doctrine of Stare decisis – “to stand by previous decisions” (also referred to as “precedent”)
- Consistency & predictability – Legal uniformity
- Allows us to plan & react in an informed way
- Ratio decidendi – "the rationale for the decision“.
- Obiter dicta - “things said by the way.”
##### Constitutional Court
- Apex court
- Jurisdiction (definition?) over all constitutional matters & public interest matters
- May sit as a court of first instance and of appeal
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- Testing right: measure state’s conduct to standards set by constitution and bill of rights
- CC can invalidate legislation or legal principles that violate the principles of freedom, equality and human dignity
- Seat in Johannesburg
- Acronym: CC
##### Supreme Court of Appeal
- Hears Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- May only hear matters brought on appeal from another court
- Caveat: CC
- Seat in Bloemfontein
- Acronym: SCA
##### High Courts
- There are 9 provincial divisions of the High Court as well as 6 local seats
- Hear Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- The Courts cover the Provinces in which they are situated
- May sit as courts of first instance & of appeal
- Acronyms: Eg WCC
##### Lower courts & special courts
- Regional courts
- Magistrate courts
	- There are100s of MCs
	- These sit both at the Regional + District levels
	- MCs hear both Civil & Criminal matters
	- They cover local areas (eg municipalities)
	- They may only hear matters sitting as a court of first instance (MCs cannot hearappeals or reviews)
- Special courts: Eg Family Court, Maintenance Court
##### The court system
- But the system is bigger…
- In addition to the courts are tribunals
	- Eg the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA)
	- This is the key body responsible for resolving labour disputes
	- BUT it does not have the status of a court
	- Instead, it is an administrative tribunal
	- So while its decisions may be made binding, it does not produce legal precedent
##### Precedent
- Constitutional Court – apex court but limited to constitutional & public interest matters
	– A minimum of 8 and a maximum of 11 judges sit on this court
- SCA – highest court, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Judgments bind all subordinate courts in SA
	– Five judges sit in a matter (sometimes 3 in criminal appeals)
- High Courts (includes Labour Court) – if no SCA/LAC decision, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Single judge bound by judgment of full bench (ie 3 judges)
- Lower Courts (eg Magistrates Courts) – bound by SCA’s and High Courts’ decisions
	– Their judgments – not precedent
- Other bodies? Eg Commission for Conciliation, Mediation & Arbitration (CCMA)
	– Generally not binding but may be influential
### Jurisdiction
(a) Monetary jurisdiction
- Small Claims Court – can hear matters involving amounts up to R20 000
- Magistrates Courts (MCs) – can hear matters up to R200 000 (District MCs) & up to R400 000 (Regional MCs)
- High Court – can hear matters from R400 000 & up (ie to an unlimited amount)
- Specialist courts/tribunals?
	– Eg consumer courts/ labour court
	– Generally, there are no monetary restrictions in these types of matters BUT the nature of the dispute is determinant
		- Eg a dispute about an unfair dismissal will go first to the CCMA and either back to the CCMA or to the Labour Court
(b) Geographical location
- The general principle in civil matters is that the plaintiff must follow the defendant to their court
	– So a plaintiff (IE the person bringing the claim to court EG Lee) has to bring the matter to the court in which the defendant (IE the person who is being sued) resides or has its principal place of business
- BUT Contracts often include an agreement as to the geographical location where claims must be brought which usually overrides the general principle
	– NOTE that sometimes, specifying the court / tribunal (or geographical location) may be unlawful
	- EG in some cases under the CPA
- NOTE ALSO some legislation provides for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
	– Consumer Protection Act
	– Labour Relations Act
### The law of obligations
- The concept “right” and “obligation”
- (Objective) law consists of legal rules
- A legal rule may confer a right upon a person = e.g. right to receive basic education
	- Afforded protection by law.
- A right is defined as the relationship between a person (legal subject) & a legal object
- Legal subject is person who holds right.
	- This could be a natural person (human being) or a juristic person (a company, a University or the State) who has legal capacity
	- Different types of persons:
		- Natural person: all human beings are natural persons, legal personality is acquired at birth & ends when a person dies, only natural persons have personality rights
		- Juristic person: all companies & close corporations are juristic persons (JPs) but also certain other institutions/registered organisations (*EG NGOs), JPs enjoy ‘perpetual succession’, the personality of a JP is separate from its shareholders/directors/employees etc
- Legal personality: holder of rights and duties, can sue or be sued in their own name
- Legal object = object to which the legal subject has a right
## Typically four types of rights are identified with reference to the legal object:
1. Personal Rights* (legal object is performance)
2. Real rights (the legal object is a thing)
3. Personality Rights (legal object is aspects of your personality)
4. Immaterial Property Rights/Intellectual Property Rights (the legal object is an intellectual product)
*Personal rights imply corresponding duties (obligations)
# The world of work
## Sources of labour law
1. Legislation
	- Constitution (always starting point!)
	- Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (LRA)
	- Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (the BCEA)
	- Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (the EEA)
	- Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 (OHSA)
	- Compensation for Occupational Diseases Act 130 of 1993 (COIDA)
	- Unemployment Insurance Act 63 of 2001 (UIA)
	- Minimum Wage Act 9 of 2018 (NMWA)
2. International and foreign law
3. Common law
4. Case law
5. Collective agreements
6. Employment contracts
## Labour law regulates various rights & obligations
- Individual rights & obligations
	- These are primarily governed by the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (LRA) & the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (BCEA)
	- Examples include the right not to be unfairly dismissed & the right to be paid overtime
- Collective rights
	- These are primarily governed by the LRA
	- Examples include the right to join a trade union and the right to strike
- Anti-discrimination rights & obligations
	- These are primarily governed by the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (EEA)
	- Examples include the right not to be discriminated against in the workplace & the obligations of employers in respect of affirmative action
- Social security rights
	- These are governed by numerous statutes, including for instance the Unemployment Insurance Act 63 of 2001 (UIA) and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 130 of 1993 (COIDA)
	- Examples include the right to be paid unemployment insurance when you lose your job & compensation for injuries at work
## Who is an ‘employee’?
- An agreement between two or more persons in terms of which the employee agrees to provide their personal services to the employer, under the control of the employer, in return for remuneration by the employer.
- Parties:
	- Employee
	- Employer
(a) someone, other than an independent contractor, who works for someone else or the state and who receives or is entitled to receive remuneration; and
(b) someone else who in any way helps to continue or operate the business
of the employer.
- Excluded? Independent contractors & others (Defence Force, Intelligence etc)
- Origin? Common law: employment contract vs independent contractors (Roman law origin)
- locatio conductio operis: was/is a contract for the completion of a particular job (independent contractor).
- locatio conductio operarum: was/is a contract for the rendering of personal services (employment contract)
- Different tests developed by the courts:
	- Control test
	- Organisation test
	- Dominant impression test
- Factors that create a presumption that the person is an employee: contained in section 200A of the LRA – BUT earning below threshold amount: R241 110,59 per year effective from 1 March 2023.
	- Manner of work subject to the control/direction of another person;
	- Work hours subject to the control/direction of another person;
	- Person forms part of the organisation;
	- Worked for an average of at least 40 hours per month over the last 3 months;
	- Economically dependent
	- Provided with tools of trade or work equipment
	- Only works for or renders services to one person.
### Essentiala of an employment contract
- Common law requirements for a valid employment contract
1. Consensus (agreement)
2. Legal capacity
3. Possibility of performance
4. Legality
5. Formalities
- Need not be in writing (verbal, tacit conclusion possible) EXCEPT where required by legislation (eg, auditing clerks)
- `Two further requirements`:
1. Employee must make their services available
2. Employer must pay the employee
- `What else should typically be included?`
	- Job description
	- Remuneration
	- Duration
	- Benefits
	- Leave
	- Restraint of trade
	- Closed shop and agency shop agreements
	- Disciplinary code
	- Dispute resolution
### Duties of employees (common law duties)
1. Duty to tender service
2. Must perform competently
3. Further the employer’s interests (duty of good faith)
	- Restraint of trade
4. Be respectful and obedient
5. Refrain from misconduct
### Duties of employers (common law duties)
1. Receive the employee into employment
2. Remunerate the employee
3. Provide safe working conditions
	- Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act
### Selected issues: Job applications
- Misrepresentation, puffery and the truth
	- G4S Secure Solutions (SA) (Pty) Ltd v Ruggiero NO & others (2017) 38 ILJ 881 (LAC)
	- When asked "Have you ever been convicted of a criminal offence?" the e/ee (a security guard) indicated that he had not.
	- 14 years later, he applied for promotion. A criminal record check indicated two previous criminal convictions.
	- The employer dismissed the employee for misrepresentation and/or dishonesty.
	- The Labour Appeal Court found the employee's dismissal was fair, given the serious nature of the misconduct committed.
- Consider common law duty of good faith
### Selected issues: Fixed term employment
- Employment contracts can be for:
	- A fixed term
	- The duration of a certain project
	- Indefinite period
- Fixed term contracts employ employees for a fixed term, until completion of a project, occurrence of a future event
- Form of employment abused in practice, LRA amended
	- Sec 186(1)(b) LRA - reasonable expectation of renewal
	- Sec 198B LRA - not longer than 3 months
	- Sec 198B – not be treated less favourably
- “Reasonable expectation”? More than subjective belief, backed up by objective facts
### Non-standard employees
- Unless (exceptions):
1. Employee temporarily replaces someone
2. Temporary increase in the volume of work
3. Student – work experience
4. Specific projects
5. Work permit for non-citizens
6. Seasonal work
7. Public works scheme/ job creation scheme
8. Outside funding
9. Retirement age
### Termination of employment
By way of:
1. Completion of the contract
2. Cancellation
	- Breach of contract - repudiation
3. Agreement
	- Note: constructive dismissal
4. Death
5. Insolvency
6. Impossibility of performance
### Breach of contract and remedies
- Normal contract law remedies available (see week 3-5)
- LRA provides for 3 possible remedies for unfair dismissal (week 6):
	- Reinstatement (in the same position) - same as specific performance in terms of common law
	- Re-employment in another suitable position
	- Compensation
### Selected issues: Probation
- Item 8 Code of Good Practice: Dismissal applies.
	- Although this Code is not strictly binding like the law (eg the LRA) is, employers are bound to follow its procedural & substantive requirements prior to dismissing or disciplining employees UNLESS they adopt an alternative but still FAIR approach/process (eg, disciplinary code).
- An employer may require a newly apppointed employees to serve a period of probation before the appointment of the employee is confirmed.
- The purpose of probation is to give the employer an opportunity to evaluate the employee's performance before confirming the appointment.
- BUT probation should not be used to deprive employees of the status of permanent employment.
- The period of probation should be determined in advance and be of reasonable duration.
	- EG 3 months
- During the probationary period, the employee's performance should be assessed.
- If below standard, advice/counselling/training on how to improve should be provided.
- If incompetent, after further advice etc, the employer may either extend the probationary period or dismiss the employee following a fair procedure.
### Selected issues: Restraint of trade
- Purpose: to protect trade secrets, intellectual property, clients
- Two conflicting principles:
	- Sanctity of contract (common law principle)
	- Freedom of trade and profession (section 22 of the Constitution)
- Contracts including restraint of trade:
	- Sale of a business (goodwill)
	- Employment contract (trade secrets, customers, intellectual property)
- If contrary to public interest = `unreasonable`
- How is reasonableness determined?
	- Does the person who wants to enforce the restraint have a legitimate interest?
	- Does the restraint only protect this interest or does it go beyond it?
		- Duration
		- Area
		- Scope
	- Protection of legitimate interest vs freedom trade of restricted person (Basson v Chilwan)
- What are legitimate interests?
	- Trade secrets, which must
		- be capable of application in trade or industry;
		- not be public knowledge or property;
		- be known only to a restricted number of people, and
		- be of economic value to the person seeking to protect it.
- Confidential information
- Client / customer connections
### Selected issues: Salary levels & overtime
- The BCEA regulates overtime
	- Its aim is to set basic minimum standards/terms & conditions for all employees BUT these do not prevent employees from negotiating or receiving better standards of employment (*employers simply may not go below those in the BCEA)
- Section 10 requires an agreement to work overtime and prohibits more than 10 hours overtime per week.
- Overtime must be paid at the rate of 1.5 times the employee’s wage.
- BUT NOTE section 6:
	- Overtime pay does not apply to “senior managerial employees” (SMEs) or to employees who earn in excess of the annual salary threshold.
	- Thus, those who are SMEs or who earn more are not entitled by law to overtime BUT their contracts may provide for overtime to be paid anyway.
### Selected issues: Private life & conscience
- There is tension between the construct of the 'loyal, obedient employee' and statutory acceptance of an employee who is permitted and encouraged to challenge, to bargain, to confront, to speak out, to report and whistle-blow, and to strike.
- Section 77 of LRA provides workers with the right to participate in socio-economic protests (*there are also constitutional rights which entitle people to express themselves/assemble/associate etc).
- Cases have held that published criticism of the employer which is not dishonest or malicious, and which does not mention any managers by name, does not usually justify dismissal.
*See also the Protected Disclosures Act (discussed later…)
### Selected issues: Disability & incapacity
- When is illness/conditions considered a disability?
- The Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities:
	- Item 5.3 provides that only people who satisfy all the criteria in the definition are regarded as having a disability.
- These include that the person has an impairment which:
(i) is long-term or recurring;
(ii) is physical or mental; and
(iii) substantially limits the employee’s prospects of entry into, or advancement in employment.
- Eg, IMATU & another v City of Cape Town and Damons v City of Cape Town 25
## Private remunerative work
- Roman Law locatio conductio operarum = employees should be ‘at the disposal of the employer’.
- The employee must further the employer’s business interests.
- Employees must devote all their normal working hours to the employer’s business and may not without the employer’s permission simultaneously work for another employer during the hours they are contractually obliged to devote to their employer’s needs.
- The relationship between the employer and employee is of a fiduciary nature – employees may not place themselves in positions where their own interests conflict with those of their employers.
- An employee cannot compete with the employer.
- There can be no conflict of interest and if there is a conflict which exists prior to employment, this must be disclosed before starting the job.
- `Outside employment policies (OEPs)`
- Some employers have OEPs but what are these all about?
	- OEPs limit outside employment and are therefore similar to restraints of trade clauses in contracts.
	- BUT they apply to e/ees during their employment rather than after it.
- The commercial rationale for an Outside Employment Policy is to manage legitimate concerns about:
	- conflicts of interest
	- the avoidance of secret profits or commission
	- distractions from job performance quality or scheduled work hours
	- misuse of the employer's resources
	- the appearance of impropriety, bringing the employer into disrepute
	- misrepresentation to or confusion of outsiders
### Selected issues: Whistleblowing
- The `Protected Disclosures Act 26 of 2000 (PDA)` facilitates whistle-blowing by protecting whistle-blowers where they disclose information (which is generally required to be in good faith/disclosed honestly/which is reasonably believed to be true), in terms of specified procedures and to specific bodies.
- S 3 provides that no employee may be subjected to any occupational detriment by the employer on account, or partly on account, of having made a protected disclosure.
	- What is an occupational detriment?
	- A negative consequence imposed on an e/ee by the e/er
	- Examples include dismissal/disciplinary action etc…
`28
Selected issues: Whistleblowing
`City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality v Engineering Council of SA & another`
- Disciplinary action was taken against Weyers for ‘misconduct’. Found guilty for writing the letter to the DOL.
- When the chair of the disciplinary tribunal refused to postpone the inquiry at the sanction stage, W approached the court for an urgent interdict, which was granted.
- The Court found that W’s action constituted a ‘protected disclosure’ in terms of the PDA.
- The disclosure was reasonable and in the public interest.
- The municipality was interdicted from imposing any disciplinary action against W for sending the letter.
- On appeal, the SCA confirmed the High Court’s finding that:
	- Honest opinions held by an expert in the field, such as Weyers, could constitute a fact and thereby fall within the ambit of the PDA.
	- The E/er was not permitted therefore to impose an occupational detriment on him (through disciplinary action).
## Workplace negligence
- This is governed by the law of delict.
- A delict is a non-criminal wrong done to another person ($*$eg crashing into someone else’s car) either negligently or intentionally.
- The test for negligence (as a requirement for a delict) is that of the fictional ‘reasonable person’.
- WHO is this reasonable person?
	- A reasonable person is an ‘objective’ person.
	- THUS the test doesn’t take into account the specific perspectives, abilities or views of the litigant.
	- Rather it considers what a reasonable person would consider to be negligent in the circumstances.
- Eg, Skhosana v Eskom
### Selected issues: Workplace conflict resolution
There are 5 basic styles to conflict resolution:
- Avoiding
- Accommodating
- Compromising
- Competing
- Collaborating.
`COMPETING`
- When quick, decisive action is vital - eg in an emergency.
- On important issues where unpopular courses of action are required (eg cost-cutting, enforcing unpopular rules, discipline)
- On issues vital to welfare, when you know you are right.
- To protect yourself against people who take advantage of non-competitive behaviour.
`ACCOMMODATING`
- When you realize you are wrong; to show you are reasonable.
- When the issue is much more important to the other person than yourself.
- To build up social credits for later issues which are important to you.

Labout Law
