At a basic level, four types of conduct rules:
1. Rules of religion
2. Rules of individual morality
3. Rules of collective morality
4. Rules of law
###### The role of the law within the engineering profession
It sets a legal precedent or standard
• Ethics
• Labour relations
• Legal structures to carry on a business & corporate governance
• Contracts
• Intellectual property
• Risk management
• Dispute resolution
###### Is the law fair or just, and should it be?
- Must legal rules be fair (reasonable) and just for it to have legal effect?
	- Fairness and being just are subjective so what seems fair and just to one community might be deemed unfair and unjust in another and laws don't have to follow subjective morality, think of america and it's attitude towards abortion and how by law it's illegal though.
- Positive law vs natural law
	- Natural law reffers to a set of unwritten rules (norms and standards) that all humans must follow without enforcement
	- Positive law?????????????????????????????????????
- How do we determine whether a rule of law is just?
	- I don't think we do refer to being just and fair
Classification of the law
• Substantive v procedural law?
• Substantive law
• Comprises legal principles
• EG it is a criminal offence to commit murder
• Procedural law
• Comprises procedural principles & requirements
• EG you must reply to a pleading (a document that needs to be submitted during court
proceedings) within 10 days














































Labout Law
- Employment contracts don't have to be in writing except for fixed term contract or training contracts
- Misconduct could be a breech of contract
- Fixed - contract for the completion of a particular project or to a date, the contract would end after the fact, no notice required
- Permanent - employment ends at retirement

### Tut 1
Identify legal problem - Company claims breech of contract based on restraint of trade.
Restraint of trade - contract that says you cant make a business out of work that competes with the employer. Aka competing with legitimate business interest.

Company can enforce the clause provided that it is not against the public interest.

Discuss the reasonableness of Robert

Yes he is, He has trade secrets from the previous job that he is trying to protect it. Because she might actually use it in her business

- Scope of restraint is too broad
