# Introduction: What is the law?
- Rules of law and other rules:
	- Various rules and norms regulate human behaviour
	- At a basic level, four types of conduct rules:
		1. Rules of religion
		2. Rules of individual morality
		3. Rules of collective morality
		4. Rules of law
- What is the rule of law?
- Rules and norms often overlap: Eg, A murders B: what basic conduct rules are implicated here?
- The role of the law within the engineering profession
	- Ethics
	- Labour relations
	- Legal structures to carry on a business & corporate governance
	- Contracts
	- Intellectual property
	- Risk management
	- Dispute resolution
- Is the law fair or just, and should it be?
	- Must legal rules be fair (reasonable) and just for it to have legal effect?
	- Positive law vs natural law
	- How do we determine whether a rule of law is just?
# Classification of the law
- Substantive v procedural law?
- Substantive law
	- Comprises legal principles
		- EG it is a criminal offence to commit murder
- Procedural law
	- Comprises procedural principles & requirements
		- EG you must reply to a pleading (a document that needs to be submitted during court proceedings) within 10 days
- __Public law__ is the law that exists between the state and its subject (ie the government & us!)
- __Private law__ is the law that exists between persons or which deals with persons alone
- __Commercial__ law to some extent is a combination of these two (above types of law) but it is also law of relevance to commerce, trade and industry
- Note:
	- There are overlaps between various categories
	- Previous slide is not a closed list - other areas of the law exist too

# Sources of South African law
1. The Constitution and legislation
2. Common law
3. Custom
4. Indigenous law
5. Court decisions/case law
## The role of the Constitution
- Supreme law and all other laws/actions/policies must comply with it
- Regulates the structure of the state, including:
	- Parliament
	- National Council of Provinces
	- President & Executive
	- Provincial legislatures
	- Local government
	- The courts
	- Chapter 9 institutions (Public Protector, SAHRC, Auditor General, Electoral Commission)
	- Public administration
	- Security services
	- Traditional leaders
	- Finance
- It also regulates the role and status of International law in South Africa
- Importantly, it includes the Bill of Rights
## Legislation
- Refers to statutes, acts, regulations etc.
- Types of legislation
- The Constitution
- Parliamentary legislation (national legislation)
- Provincial legislation (e,g, provincial regulations)
- Subordinate legislation (Local level and other)
## What is legislation?
- These are written laws passed by national / provincial / municipal government
- They bind everyone / specific groups within the population (eg creditors & debtors)
- Legislation can change existing law (eg common law principles)
- Designed to:
	- fill gaps & loopholes
	- update existing law
	- engage in social engineering
	- ensure legal protection
	- promote legal certainty & provide clarity
### Where do we find legislation?
- Statutes are published in Government Gazettes
- LexisNexis, Juta & Sabinet have electronic versions of all statutes
- You can search:
	- by title (eg Labour Relations Act)
	- by Year (eg Act 66 of 1995) OR
	- by category (eg Employment / labour law)
### How is legislation applied/enforced?
- Criminal law – enforced by police, public prosecutors & the courts
- Administrative law – courts & tribunals & criminal prosecution
- Civil law – litigation/arbitration by individuals (courts and other bodies)
- Chapter 9 Institutions – eg Public Protector
## Common law
- Not a codified system
- Roman Dutch law & English law through precedent = influenced SA law
- Applies where there is no specific legislation
- Can be ‘abrogated by disuse’ – eg crime of adultery
- Section 39(2) of Constitution – duty on courts to develop the common law (in line with the constitution & Bill of rights)
- The common law may also be amended by legislation
- Is the common law still relevant today?
- Many principles of common law are long standing and remain applicable despite legislation.
- One example is the locatio conductio operarum, a contract for rendering of personal services.
	- Employee subordinate to the will of employer.
	- Obliged to obey lawful instructions.
	- Deference, good faith, honesty and trust
- *BUT particularly in the labour law context, legislation has made substantial changes to the law
	- Eg. Fairness mechanisms
## Law of customs
- Long standing, established practices within specific communities
- Derived from the customs of society which are carried through from one generation to another.
- Usually unwritten
- Van Breda v Jacobs 1921 AD 330 ruled that a custom could be a source of law if it meets the following 4 requirements:
	- In use for a long time
	- It must be fair/reasonable
	- Certain & clear content
	- Generally recognised and faithfully observed by society
## Indigenous law
- Unwritten customary law which applies to many African communities in SA
- Today, it is applied in the ordinary courts in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws
- Once proven, it enjoys the status of common law
- Proof of indigenous law often requires expert evidence
- What if custom/customary law is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights/Constitution?
	- Eg customary rule of succession - male primogeniture
	- This led to the Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act 11 of 2009
- Ultimately, it is about developing customary law (or other laws) to ensure that it is consistent with the Constitution
	- This may happen through legislation (but there are other routes too)
## Court decisions/case law
- Not strictly a source of law but rather a statement of the law.
- Judges do not create law, they interpret it
- Doctrine of Stare decisis – “to stand by previous decisions” (also referred to as “precedent”)
- Consistency & predictability – Legal uniformity
- Allows us to plan & react in an informed way
- Ratio decidendi – "the rationale for the decision“.
- Obiter dicta - “things said by the way.”
# Constitutional Court
- Apex court
- Jurisdiction (definition?) over all constitutional matters & public interest matters
- May sit as a court of first instance and of appeal
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- Testing right: measure state’s conduct to standards set by constitution and bill of rights
- CC can invalidate legislation or legal principles that violate the principles of freedom, equality and human dignity
- Seat in Johannesburg
- Acronym: CC
# Supreme Court of Appeal
- Hears Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- May only hear matters brought on appeal from another court
- Caveat: CC
- Seat in Bloemfontein
- Acronym: SCA
# High Courts
- There are 9 provincial divisions of the High Court as well as 6 local seats
- Hear Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- The Courts cover the Provinces in which they are situated
- May sit as courts of first instance & of appeal
- Acronyms: Eg WCC
# Lower courts & special courts
- Regional courts
- Magistrate courts
	- There are100s of MCs
	- These sit both at the Regional + District levels
	- MCs hear both Civil & Criminal matters
	- They cover local areas (eg municipalities)
	- They may only hear matters sitting as a court of first instance (MCs cannot hearappeals or reviews)
- Special courts: Eg Family Court, Maintenance Court
## The court system
- But the system is bigger…
- In addition to the courts are tribunals
	- Eg the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA)
	- This is the key body responsible for resolving labour disputes
	- BUT it does not have the status of a court
	- Instead, it is an administrative tribunal
	- So while its decisions may be made binding, it does not produce legal precedent
## Precedent
- Constitutional Court – apex court but limited to constitutional & public interest matters
	– A minimum of 8 and a maximum of 11 judges sit on this court
- SCA – highest court, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Judgments bind all subordinate courts in SA
	– Five judges sit in a matter (sometimes 3 in criminal appeals)
- High Courts (includes Labour Court) – if no SCA/LAC decision, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Single judge bound by judgment of full bench (ie 3 judges)
- Lower Courts (eg Magistrates Courts) – bound by SCA’s and High Courts’ decisions
	– Their judgments – not precedent
- Other bodies? Eg Commission for Conciliation, Mediation & Arbitration (CCMA)
	– Generally not binding but may be influential
## Jurisdiction
(a) Monetary jurisdiction
- Small Claims Court – can hear matters involving amounts up to R20 000
- Magistrates Courts (MCs) – can hear matters up to R200 000 (District MCs) & up to R400 000 (Regional MCs)
- High Court – can hear matters from R400 000 & up (ie to an unlimited amount)
- Specialist courts/tribunals?
	– Eg consumer courts/ labour court
	– Generally, there are no monetary restrictions in these types of matters BUT the nature of the dispute is determinant
		- Eg a dispute about an unfair dismissal will go first to the CCMA and either back to the CCMA or to the Labour Court
(b) Geographical location
- The general principle in civil matters is that the plaintiff must follow the defendant to their court
	– So a plaintiff (IE the person bringing the claim to court EG Lee) has to bring the matter to the court in which the defendant (IE the person who is being sued) resides or has its principal place of business
- BUT Contracts often include an agreement as to the geographical location where claims must be brought which usually overrides the general principle
	– NOTE that sometimes, specifying the court / tribunal (or geographical location) may be unlawful
	- EG in some cases under the CPA
- NOTE ALSO some legislation provides for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
	– Consumer Protection Act
	– Labour Relations Act
# The law of obligations
- The concept “right” and “obligation”
- (Objective) law consists of legal rules
- A legal rule may confer a right upon a person = e.g. right to receive basic education
	- Afforded protection by law.
- A right is defined as the relationship between a person (legal subject) & a legal object
- Legal subject is person who holds right.
	- This could be a natural person (human being) or a juristic person (a company, a University or the State) who has legal capacity
	- Different types of persons:
		- Natural person: all human beings are natural persons, legal personality is acquired at birth & ends when a person dies, only natural persons have personality rights
		- Juristic person: all companies & close corporations are juristic persons (JPs) but also certain other institutions/registered organisations (*EG NGOs), JPs enjoy ‘perpetual succession’, the personality of a JP is separate from its shareholders/directors/employees etc
- Legal personality: holder of rights and duties, can sue or be sued in their own name
- Legal object = object to which the legal subject has a right
## Typically four types of rights are identified with reference to the legal object:
1. Personal Rights* (legal object is performance)
2. Real rights (the legal object is a thing)
3. Personality Rights (legal object is aspects of your personality)
4. Immaterial Property Rights/Intellectual Property Rights (the legal object is an intellectual product)
*Personal rights imply corresponding duties (obligations)














































Labout Law
- Employment contracts don't have to be in writing except for fixed term contract or training contracts
- Misconduct could be a breech of contract
- Fixed - contract for the completion of a particular project or to a date, the contract would end after the fact, no notice required
- Permanent - employment ends at retirement

### Tut 1
Identify legal problem - Company claims breech of contract based on restraint of trade.
Restraint of trade - contract that says you cant make a business out of work that competes with the employer. Aka competing with legitimate business interest.

Company can enforce the clause provided that it is not against the public interest.

Discuss the reasonableness of Robert

Yes he is, He has trade secrets from the previous job that he is trying to protect it. Because she might actually use it in her business

- Scope of restraint is too broad
