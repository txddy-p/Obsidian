# Introduction: What is the law?
- Rules of law and other rules:
	- Various rules and norms regulate human behaviour
	- At a basic level, four types of conduct rules:
		1. Rules of religion
		2. Rules of individual morality
		3. Rules of collective morality
		4. Rules of law
- Ignorance of the law is not a defence
- What is the rule of law?
- Rules and norms often overlap: Eg, A murders B: what basic conduct rules are implicated here?
- The role of law is to create standards
- The role of the law within the engineering profession
	- Ethics, Labour relations
	- Legal structures to carry on a business & corporate governance
	- Contracts, Intellectual property, Risk management, Dispute resolution
- Is the law fair or just, and should it be?
	- Must legal rules be fair (reasonable) and just for it to have legal effect?
	- Positive law vs natural law
	- <a style="color:red"> Positive Law </a>
		- rules established by the state and should be followed regardless
	- <a style="color:red"> Natural Law</a>
		- set of unwriten rules (values and norms) that humans must adhere to without enforcement 
	- How do we determine whether a rule of law is just?
## Classification of the law
- Substantive v procedural law?
- Substantive law
	- Comprises legal principles e.g. it is a criminal offence to commit murder
- Procedural law - laws abt following procedures
- __Public law__ is the law that exists between the state and its subject (ie the government & us!)
- __Private law__ is the law that exists between persons or which deals with persons alone
- __Commercial__ law to some extent is a combination of these two (above types of law) but it is also law of relevance to commerce, trade and industry
- Note:
	- There are overlaps between various categories
	- Previous slide is not a closed list - other areas of the law exist too
- The role of different types of law and what it aims to regulate:
- Constitution - type of legislation that informs all other legislation
- Legislation - gives effect to societal agreements, laws passed by parliament
- Parliament has power to enact law
- Legislative - makes laws
- Executive - enforces legislation
- Judicial - enforces legislation when theres contradiction or conflict between persons
- <a style="color:red">Legislation always has to be inline with the constitution so as to keep the government in check</a>

## Sources of South African law
1. The Constitution and legislation
2. Common law
3. Custom
4. Indigenous law - form of living law (evolved with the community)
5. Court decisions/case law
	- CC may invalidate anything that goes against the bill of human rights
### The role of the Constitution
- Supreme law and all other laws/actions/policies must comply with it
- Regulates the structure of the state, including:
	- Parliament
	- National Council of Provinces
	- President & Executive
	- Provincial legislatures
	- Local government
	- The courts
	- Chapter 9 institutions (Public Protector, SAHRC, Auditor General, Electoral Commission)
	- Public administration
	- Security services
	- Traditional leaders
	- Finance
- It also regulates the role and status of International law in South Africa
- Importantly, it includes the Bill of Rights
### Legislation
- Refers to statutes, acts, regulations etc.
- Types of legislation
- The Constitution
- Parliamentary legislation (national legislation)
- Provincial legislation (e,g, provincial regulations)
- Subordinate legislation (Local level and other)
#### What is legislation?
- These are written laws passed by national / provincial / municipal government
- They bind everyone / specific groups within the population (eg creditors & debtors)
- Legislation can change existing law (eg common law principles)
- Designed to:
	- fill gaps & loopholes
	- update existing law
	- engage in social engineering
	- ensure legal protection
	- promote legal certainty & provide clarity
#### Where do we find legislation?
- Statutes are published in Government Gazettes
- LexisNexis, Juta & Sabinet have electronic versions of all statutes
- You can search:
	- by title (eg Labour Relations Act)
	- by Year (eg Act 66 of 1995) OR
	- by category (eg Employment / labour law)
#### How is legislation applied/enforced?
- Criminal law – enforced by police, public prosecutors & the courts
- Administrative law – courts & tribunals & criminal prosecution
- Civil law – litigation/arbitration by individuals (courts and other bodies)
- Chapter 9 Institutions – eg Public Protector
### Common law
- Not a codified system
- Roman Dutch law & English law through precedent = influenced SA law
- Applies where there is no specific legislation
- Can be ‘abrogated by disuse’ – eg crime of adultery
- Section 39(2) of Constitution – duty on courts to develop the common law (in line with the constitution & Bill of rights)
- The common law may also be amended by legislation
- Is the common law still relevant today?
- Many principles of common law are long standing and remain applicable despite legislation.
- One example is the locatio conductio operarum, a contract for rendering of personal services.
	- Employee subordinate to the will of employer.
	- Obliged to obey lawful instructions.
	- Deference, good faith, honesty and trust
- *BUT particularly in the labour law context, legislation has made substantial changes to the law
	- Eg. Fairness mechanisms
### Law of customs
- Long standing, established practices within specific communities
- Derived from the customs of society which are carried through from one generation to another.
- Usually unwritten
- Van Breda v Jacobs 1921 AD 330 ruled that a custom could be a source of law if it meets the following 4 requirements:
	- In use for a long time
	- It must be fair/reasonable
	- Certain & clear content
	- Generally recognised and faithfully observed by society
### Indigenous law
- Unwritten customary law which applies to many African communities in SA
- Today, it is applied in the ordinary courts in accordance with the principles of conflict of laws
- Once proven, it enjoys the status of common law
- Proof of indigenous law often requires expert evidence
- What if custom/customary law is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights/Constitution?
	- Eg customary rule of succession - male primogeniture
	- This led to the Reform of Customary Law of Succession and Regulation of Related Matters Act 11 of 2009
- Ultimately, it is about developing customary law (or other laws) to ensure that it is consistent with the Constitution
	- This may happen through legislation (but there are other routes too)
### Court decisions/case law
- Not strictly a source of law but rather a statement of the law.
- Judges do not create law, they interpret it
- Doctrine of Stare decisis – “to stand by previous decisions” (also referred to as “precedent”)
- Consistency & predictability – Legal uniformity
- Allows us to plan & react in an informed way
- Ratio decidendi – "the rationale for the decision“.
- Obiter dicta - “things said by the way.”
##### Constitutional Court
- Apex court
- Jurisdiction (definition?) over all constitutional matters & public interest matters
- May sit as a court of first instance and of appeal
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- Testing right: measure state’s conduct to standards set by constitution and bill of rights
- CC can invalidate legislation or legal principles that violate the principles of freedom, equality and human dignity
- Seat in Johannesburg
- Acronym: CC
##### Supreme Court of Appeal
- Hears Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- Covers the whole of South Africa
- May only hear matters brought on appeal from another court
- Caveat: CC
- Seat in Bloemfontein
- Acronym: SCA
##### High Courts
- There are 9 provincial divisions of the High Court as well as 6 local seats
- Hear Civil & Criminal & Constitutional matters
- The Courts cover the Provinces in which they are situated
- May sit as courts of first instance & of appeal
- Acronyms: Eg WCC
##### Lower courts & special courts
- Regional courts
- Magistrate courts
	- There are100s of MCs
	- These sit both at the Regional + District levels
	- MCs hear both Civil & Criminal matters
	- They cover local areas (eg municipalities)
	- They may only hear matters sitting as a court of first instance (MCs cannot hearappeals or reviews)
- Special courts: Eg Family Court, Maintenance Court
##### The court system
- But the system is bigger…
- In addition to the courts are tribunals
	- Eg the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA)
	- This is the key body responsible for resolving labour disputes
	- BUT it does not have the status of a court
	- Instead, it is an administrative tribunal
	- So while its decisions may be made binding, it does not produce legal precedent
##### Precedent
- Constitutional Court – apex court but limited to constitutional & public interest matters
	– A minimum of 8 and a maximum of 11 judges sit on this court
- SCA – highest court, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Judgments bind all subordinate courts in SA
	– Five judges sit in a matter (sometimes 3 in criminal appeals)
- High Courts (includes Labour Court) – if no SCA/LAC decision, bound by its own judgments (unless wrong)
	– Single judge bound by judgment of full bench (ie 3 judges)
- Lower Courts (eg Magistrates Courts) – bound by SCA’s and High Courts’ decisions
	– Their judgments – not precedent
- Other bodies? Eg Commission for Conciliation, Mediation & Arbitration (CCMA)
	– Generally not binding but may be influential
### Jurisdiction
(a) Monetary jurisdiction
- Small Claims Court – can hear matters involving amounts up to R20 000
- Magistrates Courts (MCs) – can hear matters up to R200 000 (District MCs) & up to R400 000 (Regional MCs)
- High Court – can hear matters from R400 000 & up (ie to an unlimited amount)
- Specialist courts/tribunals?
	– Eg consumer courts/ labour court
	– Generally, there are no monetary restrictions in these types of matters BUT the nature of the dispute is determinant
		- Eg a dispute about an unfair dismissal will go first to the CCMA and either back to the CCMA or to the Labour Court
(b) Geographical location
- The general principle in civil matters is that the plaintiff must follow the defendant to their court
	– So a plaintiff (IE the person bringing the claim to court EG Lee) has to bring the matter to the court in which the defendant (IE the person who is being sued) resides or has its principal place of business
- BUT Contracts often include an agreement as to the geographical location where claims must be brought which usually overrides the general principle
	– NOTE that sometimes, specifying the court / tribunal (or geographical location) may be unlawful
	- EG in some cases under the CPA
- NOTE ALSO some legislation provides for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
	– Consumer Protection Act
	– Labour Relations Act
### The law of obligations
- The concept “right” and “obligation”
- (Objective) law consists of legal rules
- A legal rule may confer a right upon a person = e.g. right to receive basic education
	- Afforded protection by law.
- A right is defined as the relationship between a person (legal subject) & a legal object
- Legal subject is person who holds right.
	- This could be a natural person (human being) or a juristic person (a company, a University or the State) who has legal capacity
	- Different types of persons:
		- Natural person: all human beings are natural persons, legal personality is acquired at birth & ends when a person dies, only natural persons have personality rights
		- Juristic person: all companies & close corporations are juristic persons (JPs) but also certain other institutions/registered organisations (*EG NGOs), JPs enjoy ‘perpetual succession’, the personality of a JP is separate from its shareholders/directors/employees etc
- Legal personality: holder of rights and duties, can sue or be sued in their own name
- Legal object = object to which the legal subject has a right
## Typically four types of rights are identified with reference to the legal object:
1. Personal Rights* (legal object is performance)
2. Real rights (the legal object is a thing)
3. Personality Rights (legal object is aspects of your personality)
4. Immaterial Property Rights/Intellectual Property Rights (the legal object is an intellectual product)
*Personal rights imply corresponding duties (obligations)
# The world of work
## Sources of labour law
1. Legislation
	- Constitution (always starting point!)
	- Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (LRA)
	- Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (the BCEA)
	- Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (the EEA)
	- Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 (OHSA)
	- Compensation for Occupational Diseases Act 130 of 1993 (COIDA)
	- Unemployment Insurance Act 63 of 2001 (UIA)
	- Minimum Wage Act 9 of 2018 (NMWA)
2. International and foreign law
3. Common law
4. Case law
5. Collective agreements
6. Employment contracts
## Labour law regulates various rights & obligations
- Individual rights & obligations
	- These are primarily governed by the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995 (LRA) & the Basic Conditions of Employment Act 75 of 1997 (BCEA)
	- Examples include the right not to be unfairly dismissed & the right to be paid overtime
- Collective rights
	- These are primarily governed by the LRA
	- Examples include the right to join a trade union and the right to strike
- Anti-discrimination rights & obligations
	- These are primarily governed by the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (EEA)
	- Examples include the right not to be discriminated against in the workplace & the obligations of employers in respect of affirmative action
- Social security rights
	- These are governed by numerous statutes, including for instance the Unemployment Insurance Act 63 of 2001 (UIA) and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 130 of 1993 (COIDA)
	- Examples include the right to be paid unemployment insurance when you lose your job & compensation for injuries at work
## Who is an ‘employee’?
- An agreement between two or more persons in terms of which the employee agrees to provide their personal services to the employer, under the control of the employer, in return for remuneration by the employer.
- Parties:
	- Employee
	- Employer
(a) someone, other than an independent contractor, who works for someone else or the state and who receives or is entitled to receive remuneration; and
(b) someone else who in any way helps to continue or operate the business
of the employer.
- Excluded? Independent contractors & others (Defence Force, Intelligence etc)
- Origin? Common law: employment contract vs independent contractors (Roman law origin)
- locatio conductio operis: was/is a contract for the completion of a particular job (independent contractor).
- locatio conductio operarum: was/is a contract for the rendering of personal services (employment contract)
- Different tests developed by the courts:
	- Control test
	- Organisation test
	- Dominant impression test
- Factors that create a presumption that the person is an employee: contained in section 200A of the LRA – BUT earning below threshold amount: R241 110,59 per year effective from 1 March 2023.
	- Manner of work subject to the control/direction of another person;
	- Work hours subject to the control/direction of another person;
	- Person forms part of the organisation;
	- Worked for an average of at least 40 hours per month over the last 3 months;
	- Economically dependent
	- Provided with tools of trade or work equipment
	- Only works for or renders services to one person.
### Essentiala of an employment contract
- Common law requirements for a valid employment contract
1. Consensus (agreement)
2. Legal capacity
3. Possibility of performance
4. Legality
5. Formalities
- Need not be in writing (verbal, tacit conclusion possible) EXCEPT where required by legislation (eg, auditing clerks)
- `Two further requirements`:
1. Employee must make their services available
2. Employer must pay the employee
- `What else should typically be included?`
	- Job description
	- Remuneration
	- Duration
	- Benefits
	- Leave
	- Restraint of trade
	- Closed shop and agency shop agreements
	- Disciplinary code
	- Dispute resolution
### Duties of employees (common law duties)
1. Duty to tender service
2. Must perform competently
3. Further the employer’s interests (duty of good faith)
	- Restraint of trade
4. Be respectful and obedient
5. Refrain from misconduct
### Duties of employers (common law duties)
1. Receive the employee into employment
2. Remunerate the employee
3. Provide safe working conditions
	- Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act
### Selected issues: Job applications
- Misrepresentation, puffery and the truth
	- G4S Secure Solutions (SA) (Pty) Ltd v Ruggiero NO & others (2017) 38 ILJ 881 (LAC)
	- When asked "Have you ever been convicted of a criminal offence?" the e/ee (a security guard) indicated that he had not.
	- 14 years later, he applied for promotion. A criminal record check indicated two previous criminal convictions.
	- The employer dismissed the employee for misrepresentation and/or dishonesty.
	- The Labour Appeal Court found the employee's dismissal was fair, given the serious nature of the misconduct committed.
- Consider common law duty of good faith
### Selected issues: Fixed term employment
- Employment contracts can be for:
	- A fixed term
	- The duration of a certain project
	- Indefinite period
- Fixed term contracts employ employees for a fixed term, until completion of a project, occurrence of a future event
- Form of employment abused in practice, LRA amended
	- Sec 186(1)(b) LRA - reasonable expectation of renewal
	- Sec 198B LRA - not longer than 3 months
	- Sec 198B – not be treated less favourably
- “Reasonable expectation”? More than subjective belief, backed up by objective facts
### Non-standard employees
- Unless (exceptions):
1. Employee temporarily replaces someone
2. Temporary increase in the volume of work
3. Student – work experience
4. Specific projects
5. Work permit for non-citizens
6. Seasonal work
7. Public works scheme/ job creation scheme
8. Outside funding
9. Retirement age
### Termination of employment
By way of:
1. Completion of the contract
2. Cancellation
	- Breach of contract - repudiation
3. Agreement
	- Note: constructive dismissal
4. Death
5. Insolvency
6. Impossibility of performance
### Breach of contract and remedies
- Normal contract law remedies available (see week 3-5)
- LRA provides for 3 possible remedies for unfair dismissal (week 6):
	- Reinstatement (in the same position) - same as specific performance in terms of common law
	- Re-employment in another suitable position
	- Compensation
### Selected issues: Probation
- Item 8 Code of Good Practice: Dismissal applies.
	- Although this Code is not strictly binding like the law (eg the LRA) is, employers are bound to follow its procedural & substantive requirements prior to dismissing or disciplining employees UNLESS they adopt an alternative but still FAIR approach/process (eg, disciplinary code).
- An employer may require a newly apppointed employees to serve a period of probation before the appointment of the employee is confirmed.
- The purpose of probation is to give the employer an opportunity to evaluate the employee's performance before confirming the appointment.
- BUT probation should not be used to deprive employees of the status of permanent employment.
- The period of probation should be determined in advance and be of reasonable duration.
	- EG 3 months
- During the probationary period, the employee's performance should be assessed.
- If below standard, advice/counselling/training on how to improve should be provided.
- If incompetent, after further advice etc, the employer may either extend the probationary period or dismiss the employee following a fair procedure.
### Selected issues: Restraint of trade
- Purpose: to protect trade secrets, intellectual property, clients
- Two conflicting principles:
	- Sanctity of contract (common law principle)
	- Freedom of trade and profession (section 22 of the Constitution)
- Contracts including restraint of trade:
	- Sale of a business (goodwill)
	- Employment contract (trade secrets, customers, intellectual property)
- If contrary to public interest = `unreasonable`
- How is reasonableness determined?
	- Does the person who wants to enforce the restraint have a legitimate interest?
	- Does the restraint only protect this interest or does it go beyond it?
		- Duration
		- Area
		- Scope
	- Protection of legitimate interest vs freedom trade of restricted person (Basson v Chilwan)
- What are legitimate interests?
	- Trade secrets, which must
		- be capable of application in trade or industry;
		- not be public knowledge or property;
		- be known only to a restricted number of people, and
		- be of economic value to the person seeking to protect it.
- Confidential information
- Client / customer connections
### Selected issues: Salary levels & overtime
- The BCEA regulates overtime
	- Its aim is to set basic minimum standards/terms & conditions for all employees BUT these do not prevent employees from negotiating or receiving better standards of employment (*employers simply may not go below those in the BCEA)
- Section 10 requires an agreement to work overtime and prohibits more than 10 hours overtime per week.
- Overtime must be paid at the rate of 1.5 times the employee’s wage.
- BUT NOTE section 6:
	- Overtime pay does not apply to “senior managerial employees” (SMEs) or to employees who earn in excess of the annual salary threshold.
	- Thus, those who are SMEs or who earn more are not entitled by law to overtime BUT their contracts may provide for overtime to be paid anyway.
### Selected issues: Private life & conscience
- There is tension between the construct of the 'loyal, obedient employee' and statutory acceptance of an employee who is permitted and encouraged to challenge, to bargain, to confront, to speak out, to report and whistle-blow, and to strike.
- Section 77 of LRA provides workers with the right to participate in socio-economic protests (*there are also constitutional rights which entitle people to express themselves/assemble/associate etc).
- Cases have held that published criticism of the employer which is not dishonest or malicious, and which does not mention any managers by name, does not usually justify dismissal.
*See also the Protected Disclosures Act (discussed later…)
### Selected issues: Disability & incapacity
- When is illness/conditions considered a disability?
- The Code of Good Practice on the Employment of People with Disabilities:
	- Item 5.3 provides that only people who satisfy all the criteria in the definition are regarded as having a disability.
- These include that the person has an impairment which:
(i) is long-term or recurring;
(ii) is physical or mental; and
(iii) substantially limits the employee’s prospects of entry into, or advancement in employment.
- Eg, IMATU & another v City of Cape Town and Damons v City of Cape Town 25
## Private remunerative work
- Roman Law locatio conductio operarum = employees should be ‘at the disposal of the employer’.
- The employee must further the employer’s business interests.
- Employees must devote all their normal working hours to the employer’s business and may not without the employer’s permission simultaneously work for another employer during the hours they are contractually obliged to devote to their employer’s needs.
- The relationship between the employer and employee is of a fiduciary nature – employees may not place themselves in positions where their own interests conflict with those of their employers.
- An employee cannot compete with the employer.
- There can be no conflict of interest and if there is a conflict which exists prior to employment, this must be disclosed before starting the job.
- `Outside employment policies (OEPs)`
- Some employers have OEPs but what are these all about?
	- OEPs limit outside employment and are therefore similar to restraints of trade clauses in contracts.
	- BUT they apply to e/ees during their employment rather than after it.
- The commercial rationale for an Outside Employment Policy is to manage legitimate concerns about:
	- conflicts of interest
	- the avoidance of secret profits or commission
	- distractions from job performance quality or scheduled work hours
	- misuse of the employer's resources
	- the appearance of impropriety, bringing the employer into disrepute
	- misrepresentation to or confusion of outsiders
### Selected issues: Whistleblowing
- The `Protected Disclosures Act 26 of 2000 (PDA)` facilitates whistle-blowing by protecting whistle-blowers where they disclose information (which is generally required to be in good faith/disclosed honestly/which is reasonably believed to be true), in terms of specified procedures and to specific bodies.
- S 3 provides that no employee may be subjected to any occupational detriment by the employer on account, or partly on account, of having made a protected disclosure.
	- What is an occupational detriment?
	- A negative consequence imposed on an e/ee by the e/er
	- Examples include dismissal/disciplinary action etc…
`28
Selected issues: Whistleblowing
`City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality v Engineering Council of SA & another`
- Disciplinary action was taken against Weyers for ‘misconduct’. Found guilty for writing the letter to the DOL.
- When the chair of the disciplinary tribunal refused to postpone the inquiry at the sanction stage, W approached the court for an urgent interdict, which was granted.
- The Court found that W’s action constituted a ‘protected disclosure’ in terms of the PDA.
- The disclosure was reasonable and in the public interest.
- The municipality was interdicted from imposing any disciplinary action against W for sending the letter.
- On appeal, the SCA confirmed the High Court’s finding that:
	- Honest opinions held by an expert in the field, such as Weyers, could constitute a fact and thereby fall within the ambit of the PDA.
	- The E/er was not permitted therefore to impose an occupational detriment on him (through disciplinary action).
## Workplace negligence
- This is governed by the law of delict.
- A delict is a non-criminal wrong done to another person ($*$eg crashing into someone else’s car) either negligently or intentionally.
- The test for negligence (as a requirement for a delict) is that of the fictional ‘reasonable person’.
- WHO is this reasonable person?
	- A reasonable person is an ‘objective’ person.
	- THUS the test doesn’t take into account the specific perspectives, abilities or views of the litigant.
	- Rather it considers what a reasonable person would consider to be negligent in the circumstances.
- Eg, Skhosana v Eskom
### Selected issues: Workplace conflict resolution
There are 5 basic styles to conflict resolution:
- Avoiding
- Accommodating
- Compromising
- Competing
- Collaborating.
`COMPETING`
- When quick, decisive action is vital - eg in an emergency.
- On important issues where unpopular courses of action are required (eg cost-cutting, enforcing unpopular rules, discipline)
- On issues vital to welfare, when you know you are right.
- To protect yourself against people who take advantage of non-competitive behaviour.
`ACCOMMODATING`
- When you realize you are wrong; to show you are reasonable.
- When the issue is much more important to the other person than yourself.
- To build up social credits for later issues which are important to you.
- When continued competition would damage your cause.
- When preserving harmony and avoiding disruption are especially important.
`COMPROMISING`
- When goals are moderately important, but not worth the effort or potential disruption of more assertive modes.
- When two opponents with equal power are strongly committed to mutually exclusive goals.
- To arrive at expedient solutions under time pressure.
- To achieve temporary settlements to complex issues.
- A back-up mode when joint-problem solving or competition fails.
`JOINT-PROBLEM SOLVING / COLLABORATING`
- To find an integrative solution when both sets of concerns are too important to be compromised.
- When your objective is to learn (EG testing assumptions, or seeking to understand other views)
- To merge insights with different perspectives of the problem.
- To gain commitment by incorporating other’s concerns.
- To work through hard feelings.
# FORMATION OF A VALID CONTRACT
## GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CONTRACT
### 1. THE FORMATION OF A VALID CONTRACT
- In order for a contract to be valid and binding in law, certain requirements have to be met. All the requirements must be met, if one is missing then there will normally not be a valid contract and the courts will refuse to enforce it.
1. The parties must have contractual capacity
2. The parties must have a serious intention to contract
3. The parties must communicate their intention to each other
offer & acceptance
4. The parties must be of the same mind, i.e. no misunderstandings or mistakes
5. The agreement must lawful
6. Performance of the contractual obligations must be possible
7. The agreement must comply with any formalities
8. The agreement must be certain in its terms
#### 1.1 Contractual Capacity
General rule?
Exceptions: limited contractual capacity
People with limited contractual capacity are:
- Married persons
- Minors
- $*$Insolvents
- Mentally ill and
- $*$intoxicated persons.
##### (a) MARRIED PERSONS
1. Marriages In Community Of Property (ICOP)
2. Marriage out of community (OCOP)
3. Marriage out of community with accrual
###### Marriages In Community Of Property (ICOP)
- Assets – before marriage
- Liabilities – before marriage
- Assets – after marriage
- Liabilities – after marriage
Focus is on contractual capacity!
###### (ICOP): terminology
- Matrimonial Property Act (MPA)1984

| Term     | Description                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Alienate | sell, mortgage, lease out (as lessor/landlord),give away                                                     |
| Cede     | manner of alienating usually used for intangible assets                                                      |
| Mortgage | you borrow money to purchase immovable property and as security for that loan, you mortgage the property. EG |
| Pledge   | give something as security. EG                                                                               |
- General rule:
- Exceptions: i.e
- Why is this section important to you?
###### Formal consent
Formal consent is a written and signed consent witnessed by two witnesses.
i. Alienate or mortgage immovable property
ii.Enter into as a credit receiver, a credit agreement in terms of the National Credit Act 2005
iii. Bind him/herself as surety
- In case of (ii ) consent can be given by ratification. But must still be in writing (signed) before two witnesses.
- Consent is not required for (ii) + (iii) if the a c t is done in the `ordinary course of that spouse’s trade or business or occupation? AI`
###### Written consent?
i. Alienate, cede or pledge any shares, insurance policies, fixed deposits, or any investments in a financial institution. (financial investment assets.):
- But don’t need consent to sell shares listed on JSE or to deal with a deposit in one’s own name at a bank (fact check?)
- Don’t need consent if the act is done in connection with the spouse’s trade, business or occupation
ii. Alienate or pledge jewellery, coins, paintings etc. (capital assets)
iii. Withdraw money held in the name of the other spouse at bank, building society or post office
Ratification?
Exception? Trader.
###### Informal consent
This is a verbal consent?
i. Alienating or pledging household furniture and effects
ii. Receiving money due to the other spouse from:
- their trade, business or occupation e.g. salary or pension
- inheritance, donation , bursary or prize (fact check?)
iii. Large donations from joint estate. EG
REMEMBER
- If the act has not been listed in any of the categories above, then no consent is needed.
- This is a verbal consent.
- Ratification?
- Overlap?
###### Transactions made without consent
- General rule:
- However, there is an exception:
- If the third party (other party to contract )does not know or could not reasonably have known that the required consent had not been given, then the contract is valid.
- If the contracting spouse knew that he or she would not get consent and the estate has suffered a loss, then an adjustment will be made in favour of the other spouse upon dissolution of the marriage
- Transactions made without consent
## Guidance
1. Step 1: Identify the area you are dealing with.
2. Step 2: Identify the applicable law.
3. Step 3: Identify the issue.
4. Step 4: set out the applicable legal rules
5. Step 5: apply the law.
6. Step 6: conclude.
###### Marriages Out of Community of Property (OCOP) & Marriages Out of Community of Property with the Accrual (Accrual)
Example:
Let’s illustrate the calculation of the accrual with an example. Suppose John and Mary got married in 2000 and decided to get divorced in 2023. At the commencement of their marriage in 2000, John’s net estate was valued at ZAR 1,500,000, and Mary’s net estate was valued at ZAR 2,000,000. At the dissolution of their marriage in 2023, John’s net estate was valued at ZAR 4,000,000, and Mary’s net estate was valued at ZAR 3,000,000.
John’s accrual = ZAR 4,000,000 – ZAR 1,500,000 = ZAR 2,500,000
Mary’s accrual = ZAR 3,000,000 – ZAR 2,000,000 = ZAR 1,000,000
Since Mary’s accrual is smaller, she is entitled to claim half of the difference between the two accruals from John, which is ZAR 750,000.
##### (b) MINORS
- Who is a Minor?
###### Contractual Capacity of Minors
- Assistance by guardian? What does assistance mean and what is guardianship?
	- Guardianship (parental responsibility) means the control over and the administration of the estate (assets) of a minor, as well as assistance in performance of legal acts, such as contracting.
	- What is the meaning of assistance?
		- Express or implied? Examples. Bakery.
- Note on CPA and common law (CL) contracts:
	- ordinary course of business
###### Effect of An Assisted Contract
- The effect of a duly assisted contract is that the minor is bound and liable in terms of the contract not the guardian.
- So it is a fully valid and enforceable contract against the minor.
- The only time the minor will not b e bound by a duly assisted contract is if the contract was inherently prejudicial. The prejudice however must b e substantial and not trivial.
`Note such a contract is valid (not void) but the contract can b e cancelled.`
###### Effect Of An Unassisted Contract under the Common Law
- The contract is a “limping contract”?
- What the limping contract means is that the minor can choose (with the assistance of the guardian) whether to enforce the contract (`ratification`) or not to enforce the contract (`repudiation`).
- The choice lies solely with the minor (guardian) . Other party (the adult) is bound by that decision.
`Repudiation?`: minor not bound under law of contract and neither is other party (adult) – void.
`Ratification?`: both minor and the other party (adult) are bound by the contract – normal contractual remedies.
###### Effect of an Unassisted Contract - Consumer Protection Act 2008
- CPA only applies to certain types of agreements- mainly sale and lease and where the seller / lessor is someone who sells those goods and services in the ordinary course of business.
- The CPA says that the effect of a minor’s unassisted contract where the Act applies is that it is voidable?
- This is different from a limping contract and a void contract –will look at these voidable contracts in more detail in another section.
(1) Tebogo buys a second-hand lap from Jane who is a student at UCT
CPA or common law contract
(2) Tebogo buys a laptop from Incredible Connection IT store
CPA contract or common law?
(3) Tebogo buys a coke from Magda who runs an informal trading store at Claremont Station.
CPA contract or common law?
###### Liability of an Unassisted Minor in terms of Fraudulent Misrepresentation
Where a minor has lied about his or her age or has lied about having the guardian’s consent that is fraudulent misrepresentation.
CL?
CPA?
Because the minor lied about their age / consent, the minor could incur obligations under the law of delict.
Statutory Exceptions
##### (c) INSOLVENTS
- Sequestrated
- Insolvency Act
1. Insolvent may not enter into a contract in terms of which he disposes of assets in the insolvent estate.
2. Insolvent may not, without the written consent of the trustee, enter into contract which adversely affects the estate.
3. Insolvent may not, without the trustee’s consent b e involved in a business which is a general dealer or manufacturer.
- Contracts in contravention of the above are voidable at instance of trustee (not void). This means the contract is valid until the trustee chooses to cancel it and he may or may not choose to d o so depending on what is in the best interests of the creditors.
##### (d) MENTAL INCAPACITY ARISING FROM MENTAL ILLNESS OR INTOXICATION
###### Mental Illness
- No Insanity declaration?
- Insanity declaration?
- lucidum intervallum = sane interval
##### Intoxication
## 1.2 Agreement/Consensus
### OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE
#### (i) OFFER
- An offer is a proposal made by one party to another, containing terms and conditions which, if accepted by the other person, binds them contractually.
$$
\text{Valid offer }+\text{ valid acceptance } = \text{ valid contract}
$$
The requirements for a valid offer are:
- It must b e made with the serious intention of creating a binding and legal contract.
- It must b e complete and clear.
- It must still b e in existence at the time that it is accepted
- Person who `makes offer = offeror`
- Person `to whom offer made = offeree`
- When a valid offer is made, the offeree can decide whether to accept or reject it.
#### (1) It must be made with the serious intention of creating a binding legal contract
- General rule:
	- Whether or not a proposal = a valid binding offer depends on the facts i.e. look at the circumstances, the wording and how a reasonable person would interpret it.
- Applying this principle the courts have held that normally, the following are NOT valid offers :
- Offers made in jest?
	(1) One person says to another person, “If you can find me something decent to watch on Netflix, I will eat my hat!”
- Social arrangements
	(2)Tebello says to Sinikiwe, “Do you want to go to the movies on Saturday night?”
#### Adverts
##### Adverts Under Common Law
- General rule
	- The courts have held that normally an advert is not a valid offer. Instead, it is an invitation to do business made to the public or a group of people. 
- Advert is different from an offer which would normally be made to a specific person or specific people.
- Practical implication?
- Exceptions?
Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (1892) (in your notes).
“£100 reward will b e paid by the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.to any person who contracts influenza after having used the smoke ball according to the printed directions (3 x / day for 2 weeks).
£100 is deposited in the Bank, showing our sincerity in the matter.”
##### Adverts Under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA)
Sec 30(1) Bait marketing
- If a supplier advertises goods or services at a certain price then they must ensure that there are sufficient goods or services available at that price for consumers who respond to the advert.
- Advert: “All 2L Soda will be sold at half price on 7 March”
- How to comply with section 30? “While Stocks Last”
Sec 31 – Negative option marketing
- Negative option marketing i.e. making me an offer (eg books) which I had to do something to refuse (i.e. return the books). You can’t not do anything. Doing nothing then means you accept and if you don’t pay (in this example for the books) then you can be sued for breach of contract.
#### (2) It must be complete and clear
- The offer must contain at least the essential terms of the contract, so that an unconditional acceptance can bring about a binding contract.
(a) What are essential terms? (b) How do these differ from the 8 requirements of a valid contract?
`Sale essential terms = price + subject matter.`
- Example (1):
	- Would you like to buy my Toyota Yaris car for R50 000?
	- Is this a complete offer?
- Example (2):
	- Would you like to buy my Toyota Yaris car for between R 40 000 to R50 000?
- Example (3):
	- I am selling you my Toyota Yaris car for R0.
- Example (4):
	- I am offering you my Toyota Yaris car in exchange for your Kia Rio.
Cliff v Electronic Media Network (M Net) (GJ) 2016
Non – essential terms?
#### (3) It must still be in existence at time it is accepted
An offer will terminate or cease to exist in one of three ways:
1. Revocation
2. Lapse of offer
3. Rejection
##### Revocation
- Rule: Offeror can revoke any offer any time before acceptance - communication – breach.
##### Lapse of offer?
- Reasonable time
- Specified time
- Death
- Conflict with essential terms.
##### Rejection
Express
Counter-offer is a form of rejection.
#### (ii) ACCEPTANCE
The following are the requirements for a valid acceptance:
1. The acceptance must be made by the particular person(s) to whom the offer was addressed
2. The acceptance must b e made “knowingly”
3. The acceptance must b e clear and unconditional
	1. A conditional acceptance (“yes but”) is not acceptance but rather a rejection and counter-offer
4. The acceptance must b e communicated to the offeror in the prescribed manner
5. It must be made before the offer comes to an end

##### (4) Acceptance must be communicated to the offeror in the prescribed manner
- At what point is acceptance taken to have been communicated to offeror?
- Important because once acceptance has been communicated, it is at that time and place that we have a valid contact.
- Different theories are applied to determine the time and place that the contract is concluded (entered into).
###### (4.1) Information theory
- Applies to phone, fax and in person face to face.
- It is also the general rule/default position if other theories don’t apply.
- In terms of the information theory, acceptance is only valid and the contract concluded once it has been communicated to the offeror.
- The contract is therefore concluded at the time and place where the acceptance comes to the attention of the offeror.
- So offeror must actually receive it, see it or hear it .
- Remember this theory is the general rule/default position if other theories don’t apply.
###### (4.2) Expedition theory
This applies where the offeror:
- makes the offer via the post or
- authorises acceptance by post
Then , if offeree accepts by post, the acceptance takes place and contract concluded at the time and place where the letter of acceptance is posted. – EXCEPTIONS?
###### (4.3) Reception theory
- Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 2002 (ECTA) applies to contracts made via email or other kinds of electronic communication such as sms, whatsapp.
- In terms of this act, a contract is concluded at the time and place where the acceptance is received by the offeror.
- An electronic message is received by the offeror when the complete data message enters his information system and is capable of being retrieved and processed by him. (Sec 23)
- So the contract is concluded at the time and place where the email(or text message etc.) is sitting in the offeror’s inbox, even if he has not yet checked it.
##### General Points to Remember:
- With a fax, “communicated” means that acceptance is valid when the offeror actually reads the fax, and not when it is just sitting in the fax machine. So the information theory will apply to a fax i.e. the offeror must have read the acceptance fax for the contract to b e concluded. It is not concluded when the fax is just sitting in the fax machine. So reception theory does not apply.
- The default theory is the information theory if the expedition and reception theories don’t apply.
- The offeror can always stipulate that acceptance will only b e valid once he has read it.
## 1.3. FACTORS AFFECTING CONSENSUS
- In this section we will be looking at mistake, misrepresentation, duress and undue influence. Brief explanation of each – later.
- These may either render a contact void or voidable.
### Void Contracts
- The contract will be normally be void if any of the essential requirements are missing:
- In this section we are concerned with contracts which are void due to mistake.
- Void = never existed . Any claim is under unjustified enrichment. Why?
### Voidable Contracts
- Contract can be voidable when all the requirements for a valid contract are present, but there is a defect in the consent of one of the parties.
- The defect can be due to misrepresentation, duress or undue influence?
- The party who has been wronged has an election:
	- cancel the contract (set it aside/ rescind) and claim restitution i.e. each party restores full performance to the other OR
	- abide by the contract
- But until party makes his election, there is a valid & binding contract
### (i) MISTAKE
Mistake (both common and unilateral) renders a contract VOID.
##### Common mistake - both parties share the same mistake
- In order for a common mistake to render a contract void the mistake must be material
##### Unilateral mistake – only one party is mistaken, the other is not.
- In order for a unilateral error to render a contract void the mistake must be: material $\textbf{AND}$ reasonable i.e a iustus error
Material Mistake = for common and unilateral
- General rule is that a mistake is material if the person would not have contracted had they known the true state of affairs
- Applying this rule, the courts have identified a list of material mistakes but it is not a closed list. The following are material errors:
1. Mistake as to the type of contract e.g. A thinks it is a sale and B thinks it is a lease
2. Mistake as to the subject matter e.g. our example with the tin of oats
3. Mistake as to the identity of the parties - but only where identity is an essential ingredient of the contract – employment and marriage
4. Mistake as to terms of contract e.g. R5000 v R 50 000 purchase price
Following are not material errors- even if the person would not have contracted had they known the true state of affairs.
1. Mistake as to attributes or quality of the subject matter
2. An error in motive
Reasonable Mistake /Iustus Error = only applies to unilateral mistake
- An error will be iustus in ONE of the following two situations:
1. If the other party (the one who is NOT mistaken) knows or ought to have known that the mistaken party had made an error. Horty Investments v Interior Acoustics 1984 (3) SA 537 (W)
OR
2. If the other party misled the mistaken party.
### Iustus Error and Caveat Subscriptor- Signed Contracts
- What does a person’s signature on the agreement indicate to the other contracting party and to the world generally?
- Essentially the idea is that even if you have signed a contract and thus triggered the Caveat Subscriptor rule, you can still escape the contract if you can prove that the mistake was reasonable.
- Exceptional cases – certainty.
- Common law principle: caveat subscriptor =
	-If a person signs a contract he is bound by that contract even if he has not read it or understood it.
- Exceptions to the caveat subscriptor principle:
- In each of the exceptional cases, court relied heavily on mistake and iustus error and applied them to the particular facts:
## 1.3. FACTORS AFFECTING CONSENSUS (continued)
- In this section we will look at misrep (misrepresentation), duress and undue influence which can make a contract voidable?
- Freedom of contract
- Volition - willingly
- A contract can b e voidable when all the requirements for a valid contract are present, but there is a defect in the consent of one of the parties.
- In other words it seems that there is consensus i.e. that both parties are in agreement, but in fact, the consent of one of the parties is defective.
- This defect can b e due to misrepresentation, duress or undue influence
- So for example, in the case of duress: If Jane holds a gun to Bongiwe’s head and threatens to kill her if she does not sign the contract, and then Bongiwe signs, Bongiwe has consented (agreed) to the contract, but that consent is defective,
### (II) MISREPRESENTATION – COMMON LAW
- Misrepresentation renders a contract voidable.
- A misrepresentation is a false statement of fact made by one person to another, with the intention of causing the other party to enter into the contract, and which does actually cause him to enter into the contract .
- NB: So these are pre-contractual statements. (made during negotiations)
#### Types of misrepresentation
1. Fraudulent misrep:
2. Negligent misrep:
3. Innocent mispresenation:
##### Forms of misrepresentation
Whether the misrep is fraudulent, negligent or innocent, it can occur in different ways:
1. Verbal/written misrep:
2. Misrep by conduct:
3. Misrep by silence (non- disclosure)
- General rule in SA law – there is no duty to speak or disclose information.
###### There are a few exceptions (where one must make full disclosure):
a. Where the person has told a half truth and creates a misleading impression.
b. Where he has, by his conduct, prevented the other party from discovering the true state of affairs.
c. Where he has by an earlier statement or conduct given the other party a certain impression and circumstances have changed.
d. Where the facts are in the exclusive knowledge of the one party
e. Common law rule that a seller must disclose latent defects (i.e. defects that are not obvious)
#### Basic requirements for misrep to render a contract voidable:
1. The misrepresentation was a false statement of fact
Examples
Relevant factors are the following:
- Was the statement m a d e in answer to a direct question – then probably fact
- Did the maker of the statement know it was important to the other party - then probably fact
- Would the reasonable person think it was fact, puff or opinion?
2. The misrep did induce the contract i.e. a causal misrep
- Causal misrep = person would not have contracted at all = voidable
- Incidental misrep = person would still have contracted or contracted on less favourable terms = not voidable
3. Misrep was m a d e by the other party to the contract
#### Consequences of misrep
1. Contractual Remedies
- apply to all types & forms of misrep
- If all three requirements are met then contract is voidable = Cancellation/ recession and restitution OR Person can choose to abide by the contract
2. Delictual Damages
- A delict is a wrongful a c t that cause harm.
- Wrongful a c t = fraudulent or negligent misrep.
- Harm = financial loss
### (III) MISREPRESENTATION – CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT
1. Misrepresentation is not allowed, by words, conduct or silence.
2. Re misrep by silence, seems to b e a general duty to speak.
3. Seems that even opinions may render a contract voidable (so not only misrep of fact to make contract voidable ).
### (IV) DURESS
- Common law
	- Contract will only be voidable if all of the following reqs are met.
1. It was a threat of considerable evil (harm) to a person (including his reputation/personality), his family or his property.
2. The threat of evil or harm must be immediate or inevitable.
3. The threat must have actually induced the person to enter into the contract or to contract on less favourable terms.
4. The threat must be unlawful or contra bonos mores.
5. The fear must be reasonable CPA and Duress
“Supplier … must not use physical force against a consumer, ….duress, harassment, or any similar conduct….” or “take advantage due to physical or mental disability, illiteracy,
### (v) Undue Influence
Common law
In order for undue influence to render the contract voidable, all of the following reqs. must be proved:
1. The one party exercised an influence over the wronged party.
2. The influence must have weakened the wronged party's powers of resistance and made him easily manipulated.
3. The influence must have been exercised in an unethical manner
4. The influence must have induced the wronged party to enter into a transaction which is prejudicial to him and which he would not have concluded of his own free will.
- CPA and Undue Influence
“ Supplier must not use coercion,….., undue influence, harassment , or any similar conduct….” or “take advantage due to
physical or mental disability, illiteracy, ignorance, inability to
understand.”









































Labout Law
- Employment contracts don't have to be in writing except for fixed term contract or training contracts
- Misconduct could be a breech of contract
- Fixed - contract for the completion of a particular project or to a date, the contract would end after the fact, no notice required
- Permanent - employment ends at retirement

### Tut 1
Identify legal problem - Company claims breech of contract based on restraint of trade.
Restraint of trade - contract that says you cant make a business out of work that competes with the employer. Aka competing with legitimate business interest.

Company can enforce the clause provided that it is not against the public interest.

Discuss the reasonableness of Robert

Yes he is, He has trade secrets from the previous job that he is trying to protect it. Because she might actually use it in her business

- Scope of restraint is too broad
