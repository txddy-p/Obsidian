At a basic level, four types of conduct rules:
1. Rules of religion
2. Rules of individual morality

###### Is the law fair or just, and should it be?
- Must legal rules be fair (reasonable) and just for it to have legal effect?
	- Fairness and being just are subjective so what seems fair and just to one community might be deemed unfair and unjust in another and laws don't have to follow subjective morality, think of america and it's attitude towards abortion and how by law it's illegal though.
- Positive law vs natural law
	- Natural law reffers to a set of unwritten rules (norms and standards) that all humans must follow without enforcement
	- Positive law?????????????????????????????????????
- How do we determine whether a rule of law is just?
	- I don't think we do refer to being just and fair
