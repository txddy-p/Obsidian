# COLLECTIVE INVESTMENTS
## WHAT IS A COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT SCHEME (CIS)?
- A CIS refers to a group of investors who have come together to pool their money in order to invest in a spread of professionally managed investments.
- One important characteristic of a CIS is that investors share the risks and benefits in the scheme in proportion to their share of in the investment.
- An example of a CIS in SA is a ‚ÄúUnit Trust‚Äù. The CIS Act of 2002 has made provision for many other types of CISs (e.g. hedge funds, Open ended investments schemes etc.)
## HISTORY OF THE CIS
- First CIS in SA was the unit trust
- First unit trust launched on 14th June 1965 ‚Äì The SAGE Fund
- Initial Assets R600K
- Grew to R1bn by 1969
- Crash of 1969 saw huge value losses
- Took 10 years to recover‚Ä¶1983 assets rose again to 1969 levels
- Number of funds grew significantly in 1980s
- By 1987 the industry had a value of R4.8bn in assets.
- Number of funds grew exponentially in the 1990s
- Value now R211bn
- Number of types of funds also grew over this period
- Increased consumer sophistication demand new specialist funds
- The industry saw another market crash in 1987
- ‚Ä¶but markets recovered in just one year‚Ä¶.
- There was a move towards international diversification‚Ä¶spurred on by foreign exchange control reform (first international fund in the 90s)
- The crash of 2008‚Ä¶saw property shares fall drastically‚Ä¶sub-prime crises‚Ä¶but industry assets still grew by 1%
- There were 950 CISs by 2010
- Impact of technology‚Ä¶
## WHY HAVE UNIT TRUSTS BEEN SO POPULAR IN SA?
- They offer an opportunity for the ordinary investor to gain access to blue chip companies listed on the JSE (otherwise out of rich).
- The process involved in buying into the trust and selling out of the trust is simple and straight forward.
- The investment is affordable, investors do not need a huge lump-sum to get into the investment, they can invest through monthly debit orders often from as little as R100.
- The costs associated with investing is made attractive due to Rand Cost Averaging.
## WHAT IS RAND COST AVERAGING?
- The investor can buy unit trusts through a debit order system for the same Rand amount on a monthly basis irrespective of the price of the shares (units).
- Without rand cost averaging, the investor would get fewer units for their fixed monthly investment if the share price goes up, or the investor would get more units if the share price goes down.
- The investor does not have to worry about constantly watching the share price.
- Avoids the risk associated with market timing (i.e., getting in the market at the wrong time).
- The share market is such that although share prices may decline form time to time, they generally follow an upward trend in the medium to long
## CIS AND COMPOUND INTEREST
- CIS benefits hugely from the power of compounding.
- Inv. A: Lump sum of R10K at 10% p.a. paid monthly over 20yrs. No re-investment
- Inv. B: Lump sum of R10K at 10% p.a. paid (compounded) monthly over 20yrs. with re-investment
- Inv. C: Monthly investment of R100 at 10%, paid (compounded) monthly over 20 years (Total invested R24000)

### HOW DOES A CIS WORK? ‚Äì EX. OF UNIT TRUST
#### FEES
Manager of the trust can charge‚Ä¶
- `Initial fees` - this normally come off the amount invested. So if you invest a lump some of R10 000 and the fee is 1%, your investment would be R9 900 and the fee R100.
- `Annual fees` - generally ranges from 0.75% - 1.5% p.a. of the value of the portfolio. Example: if portfolio is worth R1Bn. If the fee is 1.2% p.a., ‚Ä¶the fund is charged R1m per month in fees.
- `Performance fees` - applicable if performance benchmarks are achieved.
- `Portfolios charges` - generally administrations fees
- `Switching Costs` - if the investor wants to switch from one portfolio to another
#### RETURNS
Returns come from 2 sources
- Capital Growth ‚Äì These refer to changes in market value of the assets within the portfolio e.g. Share prices may increase/decrease; property prices may increase/decrease
- Income ‚Äì some assets may not enjoy capital growth, but may offer a return in the form of interest or dividends e.g. money - offers a return in the form of interest.
- Assets such as shares may offer a return in the form of capital growth and income
#### YIELDS
The yield of a unit trust is a measure of income produced by the unit trust as a percentage of the unit price e.g. add all the distributions per unit of the last 12 months and express that as a percentage of the unit price.
Example:
If the fund declares income semi-annually and has paid distributions of 5.48c and 5.68c per unit in the last 12 months and the current unit price is 223.25c per unit, the current yield would be‚Ä¶5%
$$
\frac{(5.48ùëê + 5.68ùëê)}{223.25ùëê} \times 100
$$
### TAX
#### Capital Gains Tax
- This is only applicable when the investment (or part thereof) is sold. 33.3% of the capital gain is subject to tax at the investors going rate of income tax e.g. if marginal tax is payable, the CGT will be 40% x 33.3% = 13.3%
- The first R30 000 of the gain is exempt from this tax.
- Note that CGT inclusion rate for Unit trusts is much lower than other trusts and for companies ‚Ä¶here it is 33.33%, in others it is 66.6%
#### Dividend tax
- Charged at a rate of 15% (as withholding tax)
#### Tax on Interest
- Charged as part of income‚Ä¶thresholds of R22800 and R33000 apply for people below and above 65years respectively
RISKS
- `Market Risk` ‚Äì Risk that a particular market (e.g. bond market) may perform poorly
- `Market Timing Risk` ‚Äì Risk that you may get into or out of a market at the wrong time
- `Currency Risk` ‚ÄìRisk that you may loose value on your investment and/or returns when converted back into your home currency (in the case of off-shore investments)

- `Fund Manager Risk` ‚Äì Skill of fund managers‚Ä¶Philosophy of fund managers
- `Organisational Risk` ‚Äì Risk that the CIS manager will go out of business or defraud the investors
- `Liquidity Risk` ‚Äì Liquidity of the cash component of the fund is the main concern. The mandate will stipulate a % liquidity at any point in time. Assume a mandate stipulates 25% liquidity‚Ä¶in a bear market this is fine‚Ä¶in a bull market this constitutes lost opportunities.
- `Stock Picking Risk` ‚Äì Only relevant for funds that allow concentration of investments‚Ä¶if the fund manager is not good at stock picking value could be lost‚Ä¶note there may be little diversification.
