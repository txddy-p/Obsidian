# Gears
![[involute_gear_teeth.png]]
- The module, m, is an indicator of the size of the teeth and is defined as
$$
\begin{align*}
&m = \frac{d}{N}\\
&\text{Where N is the number of teeth on a gear}
\end{align*}
$$
- The distance from the leading or trailing edge to the corresponding edge of the next tooth, when measured along the circumference of the pitch circle is the circular pitch, p.
$$
p = \frac{\pi d}{N} = \pi m
$$
- A set of meshing gears share the same pitch point P . Thus, the velocity of this point would be the same for both gears. We can therefore write
$$

\left | \omega_1\frac{d_1}{r} \right | = \left | \omega_2 \frac{d_2}{r} \right |
$$
- where $\omega_1$ and $\omega2$ are the angular speed of gears 1 and 2 and $d_1$ and $d_2$ are the pitch circle diameters of those gears.
$$
\left | \frac{\omega_1}{\omega_2} \right | = \frac{d_2}{d_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1}
$$
#### Efficiency
$$
\eta = \left | \frac{H_{out}}{H_{in}} \right | = \frac{T_{out}\omega_{out}}{T_{in}\omega_{in}}
$$
