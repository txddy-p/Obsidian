# Literature review
Here's some stuff from chatgpt that I'll expand on
Studying electronics in the Kalahari Desert presents an intriguing intersection of technology and environment. While the Kalahari is known for its harsh conditions, including extreme temperatures, arid landscapes, and limited infrastructure, there are several aspects to consider regarding electronics in this unique environment:

1. **Off-grid Power Solutions**: Given the remote and arid nature of the Kalahari, traditional power grids may be limited or non-existent in many areas. Therefore, off-grid power solutions such as solar panels, wind turbines, or even kinetic energy harvesting could be crucial for providing electricity to power electronic devices.

2. **Environmental Considerations**: The extreme temperatures and dusty conditions of the Kalahari can pose challenges for electronic devices. Electronics designed for use in this environment would need to be ruggedized and capable of withstanding high temperatures, sand, and dust ingress.

3. **Communication Infrastructure**: While connectivity may be limited in remote areas of the Kalahari, establishing communication infrastructure such as satellite internet or long-range radio networks could facilitate data transmission and remote monitoring of electronic systems.

4. **Applications in Research and Conservation**: Electronics can play a significant role in scientific research and conservation efforts in the Kalahari. For example, researchers may use GPS collars equipped with electronic sensors to track animal movements, deploy weather stations to monitor environmental conditions, or use drones for aerial surveys of wildlife populations.

5. **Community Development**: Introducing electronics and technology to communities in the Kalahari can have various socio-economic benefits, including access to information, education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. Initiatives such as providing solar-powered charging stations or training programs on electronics repair and maintenance could empower local communities.

6. **Environmental Monitoring and Management**: Electronics can be employed for monitoring and managing natural resources in the Kalahari, such as water resources, soil quality, and wildlife habitats. Sensors and data loggers can collect environmental data over time, helping researchers and conservationists make informed decisions about resource management and biodiversity conservation.

7. **Challenges and Constraints**: Despite the potential benefits, there are challenges to deploying electronics in the Kalahari, including the high cost of equipment, maintenance requirements, and the need for technical expertise. Additionally, ensuring sustainability and minimizing the environmental impact of electronic waste should be priorities in any deployment.

Overall, while the Kalahari Desert presents unique challenges for electronics deployment, innovative solutions tailored to the environment can help harness the potential of technology for various applications, ranging from scientific research to community development and environmental conservation.

## Key takeaways
- No grid so look for alternate modes of power
- High temperatures, dust and sand so devices must be resistant to these conditions
- Remote area so no communication networks, this point also circles back to power grid
- Maintenance, cost of equipment, technical expertise of person running equipment, sustainability of the equipment
- Thermal cycling and how that affects solder joints and connections due to 
- Oxidation due to sand exposure
# Draft Lit review
In the Kalahari during the day, temperatures are very high and during the night they are very low  The ground is a very good reflector of heat and this causes a heating of the air, the lack of cloud cover in the Kalahari means that this reflected heat is lost to the atmosphere because clouds would reflect the heat back into the atmosphere. This means that the Kalahari has hot days and cold nights, these fluctuations in temperature. Oxidation is also a problem because of the sand. The remote nature of the Kalahari neccessitates the inclusion of off-grid and longer lasting power storage solutions. Establishment of communication networks for data transfer or implementation of on-board storage solutions.

The Kalahari Desert, with its extreme temperature fluctuations and remote nature, presents unique challenges and opportunities for the deployment of technology and electronics. The intense heat during the day and the cold nights, coupled with the reflective properties of the ground, create a unique environment that can be harnessed for energy generation⁴¹¹. However, the same conditions also pose challenges such as oxidation due to the sandy environment.

Off-grid power solutions are particularly relevant in this context¹¹. These solutions, which often involve renewable energy sources such as solar power, are ideal for remote areas where traditional power grid infrastructure may not be feasible¹¹. Moreover, the development of longer-lasting power storage solutions is crucial to ensure the reliability of power supply, given the significant daily temperature fluctuations¹¹²⁶.

In addition to power generation and storage, the establishment of robust communication networks is vital for data transfer in these remote areas¹²³. Traditional communication infrastructures may be inadequate or non-existent in such locations, necessitating the exploration of alternative technologies¹. For instance, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and wireless mesh networks have been identified as promising solutions for enhancing connectivity in remote regions¹.

Furthermore, the implementation of on-board storage solutions is another critical aspect to consider⁸⁹[^10^]. These solutions can range from physical storage systems for goods to digital storage systems for data. In the context of the Kalahari, such solutions must be designed to withstand the harsh environmental conditions while ensuring efficiency and reliability.

In conclusion, the deployment of technology and electronics in the Kalahari Desert requires a multifaceted approach that considers the unique environmental conditions, the remoteness of the location, and the specific needs of the inhabitants. By leveraging innovative solutions in off-grid power generation, long-lasting power storage, communication networks, and on-board storage, it is possible to significantly enhance the quality of life and economic prospects in this region.
