$$
\text{Number of wheel rotations} = \frac{\text{Total encoder ticks}}{\text{Ticks per rotation}}
$$
Distance travelled = Number of wheel rotations $\times$ 2$\pi$R
$$
\text{Dist}_{\text{travelled}} = \frac{\text{ticks}_{\text{total encoder}}}{\text{ticks}_{\text{per rot}}} \times 2\pi R

# Dead reckoning
my understanding of this is that it's just telling the robot to move some distance and keep track of the distance moved
The problem that arose was that the robot didn't slow down as it approched the set-point and ended up overshooting
