## Golden Measure
- A sequential solution that you develop as the yard stick
- A solution that may run slowly, isn't optimised but you know it gives (numerically speaking) excellent results
- Its not about computation time but accuracy
## Sequential / Serial
A non-parallelized code solution
## Speed-up
- $\text{Speed-up} = \frac{T_{p1}}{T_{p2}}$ . $T_{p1}$ = run-time of original (or non-optimized) program
- $T_{p2}$ = run-time of optimised prograam
- Best practise: run the program more than once so as to warm up the system
