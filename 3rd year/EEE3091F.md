### Notes by txddy-p
The idea here is to remove the fluff and get to the meat and bones of this

### Modes of operation
Which way is the power flowing in a machine. Is the machine delivering power (Genarator) or is it using power(Motor)

![](Pwr_flow.png)

### Concentrated winding
![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/wNrsx_1z5x6AA7Zi-92pJLiPmVv_wEvJ4faCzPQm1Z2mN216AgeNljtjoxcrs72qAZIWrMJ_1S0gxFHEWR0RWw9gaXny2yaM_nXA4AlDcDLExTj3I9INHRtB4eP2l5VS.png) ![](https://remnote-user-data.s3.amazonaws.com/WfN6AKX4I6zdrU3jaJ3tfg2moaenvHkMR752w-1lFbfFsPysAtboJTUP94SRrC8LlG8VmvV7p8xidgIBLt-8EhJfGhPdhiYNB390PI-qu8Ui2ElA1ndsiYDHGokaNueI.png)

- The output is non sinusoidal because the harmonic flux densities induce harmonic voltages in the winding
- The problems associated with this configuration are:
	- Large portions of the stator remain unused
	- 2 large slots are needed to fit the coil sides in
	- The output is square because of all the harmonic content
	- Harmonic core losses (Eddy, Hysteresis, stray)

###### Disadvantages
- Require large slot sizes to accommodate the coils sides, a large  portion of the stator/rotor is then left unused.  
- MMF distribution is a square wave, so the flux density will also be a square wave. This leads to odd harmonics which produce additional losses in the machine such as heat.
 

### Distributed winding
- The harmonic content can be decreased if the winding is distributed over several slots
![[Pasted image 20230606113534.png]]

Coil sides in several slots around periphery of stator
- Stepped MMF / Flux Density distribution
    - Resembles desired Sinewave
    - Less harmonics than Square-wave in concentrated winding
- Large portion of stator utilised
- Full-pitch coils
    - Coil sides in diametrically opposite slots

###### Advantages
- Large portion of stator is utilised, coils can be fully-pitched or short- pitched
- MMF distribution is stepped in shape and better resembles a sinusoidal MMF distribution. This is what we assume in an ‚ÄúIdeal‚Äù three ‚Äì phase machine. This provides  smoother torque and less speed pulsations.
- Distributed windings make better use of the rotor/stator structure and reduce harmonics.


 
- A turn has 2 conductors associated with it and both lie in the same plane. N turns = 2N conductors
- A coil is several turns together
- A winding is several coils together
- MMF associated with the winding is perpendicular to the plane in which the coils are located
- Axis of the winding is perpendicular to the plane in which the coils are located 

# Module 3
#### Winding arrangements
- Full pitch coil 
	- is one where the coil spans 180¬∞ed.
	- coil sides in diametrically opposite slots
- Short-pitch coils:
    - Coil pitch $(\tau_c)$: (180 ‚àí ùõæ)¬∞ed < Pole pitch ($\tau_p$): (180¬∞ed)
 
Why?
Shorter end connections:
- Results in less copper
    - => Lower copper loss
- Also less leakage flux associated with end connection
- More economic because less copper is used

#### Single-layer winding
- `1 conductor per slot`
- n = slots/pole/phase means `(slots/pole)/phase)` essentially slots divided by the product of pole and phase

#### Double-layer winding
- `2 conductors per slot`
- Greater flexibility can be achieved with double layer winding as coil span can be easily  selected which makes it easier for simpler end connection.

- Consider current in the conductors and use the right hand grip rule to determine the direction of MMF and eventually you can tell how many poles there are
- Thus using the winding configuration and polarity you can determine how many poles the machine has

Assume the coil sides at the top half carry current outside the page which means a magnetic field in the anticlockwise direction i.e. in the direction of the axis of phase A

The plane(on average) on which coil sides are located is perpendicular to the axis of the winding and produce an MMF in thee direction of the axis of the winding

## Induced Voltage in Stator winding
![[Pasted image 20230329191410.png]]
$$\begin{aligned} 
B(\theta) &= B_{max}\cos{\theta}\\
\phi_p &= \int B.\,dA = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} B_{max}\cos{\theta}\,dA = \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} B_{max}\cos{\theta}lr\,d\theta\\
&=B_{max}lr \int_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos{\theta}\,d\theta\\
\Rightarrow \phi_p &= 2B_{max}lr\\
\lambda_a(t) &= \lambda_{max}\cos{\omega t} = N\phi_p \cos{\omega t}\\
e_a(t) &= \frac{\mathrm{d} \lambda_a}{\mathrm{d} t}=\omega N \phi_p \sin{\omega t}\\
E_{rms} &= \frac{E_{max}}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{2\pi f}{\sqrt{2}}N\phi_p = \sqrt{2}\pi fN\phi_p = 4.44fN\phi_p
\end{aligned}
$$
## $$E = 4.44 \cdot f\cdot N\cdot \phi_p$$
What‚Äôs the difference in induced voltage/phase for 2  configurations below?
![[Pasted image 20230329193614.png]]

- Winding factor ($K_w < 1$) used to calculate reduction in emf
### $$E = 4.44 \cdot f\cdot N\cdot \phi_p \cdot K_w$$
- Winding factor ($K_w <1$), depends on:  
	- How coils are distributed, i.e. **Distribution factor ($K_d <1$)**  
	- How coils are pitched, i.e. **Pitch factor ($K_p <1$)**
### $$E = 4.44\cdot f\cdot N\cdot \phi_p \cdot K_p \cdot K_d$$
For a concentrated winding of N turns per phase, the rms voltage induced in each phase is  
### $$E = 4.44 \cdot f \cdot N \cdot \Phi_p$$

![[Pasted image 20230329194937.png]]

## Coil voltages in Distributed Winding  

- Distribution factor (K d <1):  
	- Used to calculate reduction in emf  
	- Depends on how coils distributed

![[Pasted image 20230329195201.png]] 
$$\begin{aligned} 
K_d &=\frac{\sin{\left( n\cdot \frac{\alpha}{2} \right)}}{n\cdot \sin{(\frac{\alpha}{2})}};\\
\alpha - &\text{is the slot angle}\\
n - &\text{is \# of slots/pole/phase}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Coil voltages in full- and short-pitch coils
- Pitch factor (K p <1)  
	- Used to find reduction in emf  
	- Depends on how coils pitched

$$
\begin{aligned} 
K_p &= \cos{(\frac{\gamma}{2})};\\
\gamma - &\text{is short-pitch angle}
\end{aligned}
$$

![[Pasted image 20230329200926.png]] ![[Pasted image 20230329200945.png]]

- For full-pitch coil both e1 and e2 are maximum at the same instant (and always in series)  
- For short-pitch coil, when e1 is maximum, e2 is not maximum

## Rotating magnetic field

- Rotating field has constant amplitude  
- Rotates at constant angular speed linked to line frequency

![[Pasted image 20230330174032.png]]

## Motional Voltage: $e = B \cdot l \cdot v$
## Electromagnetic Force: $f = B \cdot l \cdot i$




### Similarly in Induction Machine in Motor mode:  
- Torque on rotor in same direction as rotating field  
- Rotor dragged behind field  
- Rotor speed < speed of rotating field  
### Difference in speed required for:  
‚û¢ Emf to be induced  
‚û¢ Current to flow

- Find Emf induced in stator and rotor phase windings !?

![[Pasted image 20230330181349.png]]

#### Recall: $E = 4.44 \cdot f \cdot N \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_w$

## Stator Induced Emf

## $$E_1 = 4.44\cdot f_1\cdot N_1 \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_{w1}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
&f_1 \text{ ... is the mains frequency in [Hz],  where }f_1 = \frac{p}{120}\cdot n_s\\
&N_1 \textbf{ ... is the number of turns/phase of the stator winding}\\
&\phi_p \text{ ... is the flux per pole in [wb]}\\
&K_{w1} \textbf{ ... is the stator winding factor}
\end{aligned}
$$


## Rotor Induced Emf (rotor at standstill):

## $$E_2 = 4.44\cdot f_1\cdot N_2 \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_{w2}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
&f_1 \text{ ... is the mains frequency in [Hz],  where }f_1 = \frac{p}{120}\cdot n_s\\
&N_2 \textbf{ ... is the number of turns/phase of the rotor winding}\\
&\phi_p \text{ ... is the flux per pole in [wb]}\\
&K_{w2} \textbf{ ... is the rotor winding factor}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Rotor Induced Emf (rotor at speed: n):
Voltage induced in rotor phase winding is:
## $$E_{2s} = 4.44\cdot f_2\cdot N_2 \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_{w2}$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
&f_2 \equiv \text{ slip frequency  ...  is frequency of rotor circuit,}\\
&f_2 \propto \text{ slip speed = }(n_s-n) = s\cdot n_s\\
&f_2 = \frac{p}{120}\cdot (n_s -n)=s\cdot f_1
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
\therefore E_{2s} &= 4.44 \cdot s \cdot f_1 \cdot N_2 \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_{w2}\\
&= s \cdot (4.44 \cdot f_1 \cdot N_2 \cdot \phi_p \cdot K_{w2})\\
\therefore E_{2s} &= s \cdot E_2
\end{aligned}
$$

![[Pasted image 20230330184504.png]]


## Rotor Induced Emf (rotor at speed: n):
- Rotor windings are short circuited.  
- 3 rotor phase currents 120 degrees displaced  
- 3 phase rotor windings has phase  displaced by 120 electrical degrees (ed) in  space



# Module 5 IM equivalent

## Principle of Operation of IM  
### Torque production mechanism:  
‚û¢ When stator windings connected to (3-phase) mains supply, currents drawn by each stator phase winding.  
‚û¢ Revolving field produced in air gap, which rotates at  synchronous speed.  
‚û¢ Voltages induced in stator and rotor windings (like transformer).  
‚û¢ If rotor circuit closed, induced voltages in rotor produces rotor currents.  
‚û¢ Rotor currents interact with revolving field, producing torque on rotor structure.  
‚û¢ Rotor rotates in direction of revolving field, but at speed less than synchronous speed (in motor mode).

### Direction of Rotation of Rotor:  
‚û¢ Question: How can direction of rotation be changed?

### Change direction of rotation of rotor???  
#### ‚û¢ Ans: 
- Change direction of rotation of revolving field. This will result in torque production in opposite direction.  
#### ‚û¢ How: 
- Change phase sequence of supply to stator! e.g. Swop currents in phase B and C windings Thus, current in phase B lags C by 120 degr.

## Power flow in stator: Motor Mode

![[Pasted image 20230330185739.png|250]]


## Stator

![[Pasted image 20230330185837.png]]

## Rotor
![[Pasted image 20230330185911.png]]


From the previous slide, the rotor current $I_2$ is:
### $$I_2 = \frac{sE_2}{R_2+jsX_2}$$
Which can be writen as 
### $$I_2 = \frac{E_2}{(\frac{R_2}{s})+jX_2}$$
Therefore, the rotor circuit converted to stator frequency $f_1$ can be drawn as shown below
![[Pasted image 20230330190901.png]]
$$\begin{aligned}
\text{Note that }\frac{R_2}{s} &=R_2 + \frac{R_2}{s}(1-s)\\
P_{ag} &= I^2_2\frac{R_2}{s}\\
P_{ag} &= P_{mech} + P_{Cu(Rot)}\\
P_{ag} &= \frac{I^2_2 R_2}{s}(1-s) + I^2_2R_2
\end{aligned}$$


## Exact Equiv circuit: Induction Motor
- The stator and rotor equivalent circuits at the same line frequency f1 can be joined  
- Refer rotor to stator using turns ratio (ùëé = N1 / N2 )  
	- Where N1 is number of turns of the stator windings and N2 in number of turns of the rotor windings.

![[Pasted image 20230330191754.png|500]]

## Power flow: Motor Mode
- If $V_1$ and $f_1$ constant => $P_\text{1\_core}$ Constant  
- From no load to full load, 0 < s < $s_\text{rated}$ ; where $s_\text{rated}$ is: 3-7%  
- $P_\text{2 core}$ increases from no load to full load, since $f_2= sf_1$  
- $P_\text{friction \& windage}$ decreases from no load to full load  
- On average, sum of above losses remain constant
