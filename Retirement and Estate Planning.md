# Retirement and estate planning
## Retirement planning
-  Life cycle
-  Marriage
-  50 + years
	-  Mortgage disappears
	-  All expenses decrease? What about medical expenses? & Lifestyle illnesses
	-  Less time to save and to grow savings as you approach retirement
-  65+ years enter into retirement (“dissaving period” – really?)
-  No formal income earned, unless you have income earning assets such as property and investments.
“Provision made previously is inadequate for retirement needs”
There are few reasons for this:
-  Advances in medicine – people live longer. Really?
-  Inflation
-  Quality of life and expected lifestyle
	-  Compromise this in retirement?
	-  Maintenance is difficult when no income is earned
	-  Therefore plan for standard of living
### Do retirement investments differ from other investments
Retirement planning differs in two aspects from other investments:
-  Retirement savings are long term in nature:
	-  Less liquid investments
	-  And penalised for early withdrawals & higher returns
-  Government encourages savings by individuals as it reduces future state financial burden
-  Regulated by Pensions Fund Act – restrictions on fund investment (Regulation 28)
	-  Regulation 28 RA’s limited exposure to asset classes maximum of 75% in equities and 15% in off- shore
### Employees benefits
-  Provision of income at retirement
-  At 65, 60 or early at 55
-  Structure of fund is discretion of employer and
-  One size fits all or customized according to employees need or choice
-  Funds specify how funds to be invested –
	-  Low risk,
	-  Medium risk -  Balanced option
	-  High risk -  Aggressive option
	-  Sharia’h compliant
	-  Switch option – twice a year at a fee
#### The difference between pension and provident funds
-  Differ in tax treatment
-  Employees can deduct up to 27.5% of the greater of their remuneration or taxable income for tax purposes – Pension funds, Provident funds and retirement annuity funds.
-  Excess carried forward
-  Provident funds were more flexible at retirement, now they are treated the same
-  Pension fund members may only take one third of retirement benefits as a cash lump sum at retirement and the balance…….
-  To be disbursed as monthly annuity
-  Provident funds could take full amount at retirement
-  Or portion and balance over retirement
##### Defined benefit
-  A defined benefit plan identifies the specific benefit that will be payable to you at retirement.
-  Your basic retirement benefit is usually based on a formula that takes into account factors: Years of employment and salary.
-  Your retirement benefit is generally provided in the form of regular payments over your life.
##### Defined contribution
-  Move towards defined contribution
-  Defined contribution -  Asset mangers manage the monthly pension contributions of employees
-  Employees have choices in the different funds as at UCT:
-  So the employees eventual value of the retirement fund depends on where he invests and the returns he earns.
#### The impact of changing employment on your pension or provident fund
-  Transferring accrued benefits to the fund of your new employer (preferred and dependent on age)
-  Transferring the funds to a retirement annuity fund (only withdraw at 55 and there is tax benefit)
-  Having your pension or provident fund pay out its value in a lump sum…2 implications: taxed and have to start over saving for retirement
-  Having the benefits transferred to a preservation fund (no tax)
	-  Same rules and provident funds
##### New Legislation
As of 1 March 2021 the South African government has introduced new
legislation where all provident and pension funds will be subject to the same
legal and tax requirements.
At retirement an employee will only be able to withdraw a third of his
pension as a lump sum and the balance will be repaid as a monthly annuity.
THIS HAS CHANGED
• See the notes on changes to Regulation 28 &
• The 2 pot system
#### Death benefits
-  Most funds provide for lump sum benefit or annuity income to beneficiaries
-  Life insurance policies paid in lump sum
-  Group life assurance – employer provides an additional benefit in the event of death
-  Premiums are tax deductible by employer but taxable in hands of beneficiaries
-  Unapproved policy -  premiums are paid for by the employer – no tax benefit for the employer and not taxed in the hands of the beneficiaries
### Retirement annuity benefits
-  Retirement annuity from age 55 and may defer receipt
-  RA advantages
	-  Tax
	-  Cannot be attached by creditors & no executor’s fees
	-  Regulation 28 RA’s limited exposure to asset classes maximum of 75% in equities and 15% in off- shore
-  RA shares characteristics with pension funds:
	-  Benefits of RA paid to members or dependants as a life annuity
	-  Pension fund only one third is paid if less than R247 500 full benefit paid to beneficiaries.
#### Annuity OPTIONS for retirement annuity funds
- Life annuity without guarantee
	- Pays benefits as long as the member is alive and cease on death.
	- Annuity is higher
- Life annuity with guarantee
	- Pays benefits as long as the member is alive or long as annuity falls within the guarantee period (whichever is higher)

	- Longer the period the lower the annuity
- A Joint life annuity
	- Member receives annuity until death and passes to spouse or common- law partner of deceased and
	- Ceases on the death of the partner
#### Tax implications for retirement funds
The contributions made by a member to a pension, provident and retirement annuity fund are tax deductible but to limited to the lesser of:

## Estate Planning
-  Distribution of Net assets to nominated beneficiaries

-  Estate consists of Assets & Liabilities – Net assets distributed to beneficiaries
-  Sound estate planning provides for the following:
	-  Efficient & appropriate administration of estate
	-  Minimisation of costs – reduced to minimum
	-  Liquidity – availability of cash to pay Estate duty and CGT ..sale of estate’s assets
-  Flexibility – changing personal circumstances such as marriage , divorce and children will impact on your estate
-  Financial plan must be flexible to be adjusted to your personal changing needs and the beneficiaries
### The will
#### Requirements for valid will (original, amendments or addendums)
-  Testator must sign end of valid will and also each page
-  Two witnesses who are not beneficiaries -  if not 2 other witnesses who are not inheriting (over age of 14)

#### Intestate succession
-  If there is no valid will
-  Process to be followed
-  Community of property (COM) to surviving spouse
-  Child’s share determined
-  Net value is divided equally between spouse and descendants:
	-  If portion is less than R125 000 – spouse receives R125 000 & balance is shared equally between descendants
	-  If greater than R125 000 – spouse & descendants receive equal shares
Example: Deceased is survived by Descendants only
-  Kevin single parent had three children, Michael, Allison & Jo
-  Michael had two children of his own Gregory & Amber
-  Estate is distributed by “per stripes”
-  Each branch of family receives an equal share
### The role of the Executor of the estate
-  Appointment ratified by Master of the High Court
-  Administration responsibility
-  Custody of assets
-  Settles all debts & costs and distributes balance to nominated beneficiaries

	-  Lodge with Master to close the estate 25
### Costs associated with estate planning
#### Estate duty
-  Under R3.5m no estate duty
-  Abatement (reduction) of R3.5 m
-  R8 m estate and husband dies and leaves the estate to wife… No duty payable
-  No estate duty payable and on passing of wife R3.5m abatement applies
-  Transfer R3.5m of $1^{st}$ spouse estate into estate called Testamentary Abatement Trust with wife as beneficiary.
-  On death of $2^{nd}$ spouse – Testamentary Abatement of R3.5m would be used and combined with 3.5m = R7m (accurate and complete records of $1^{st}$ estate).
#### Capital Gains Tax
-  Can avoid CGT at death by bequeathing growing assets to a trust with spouse or children as beneficiaries
-  Growth in assets will accrue to the trust and excluded from the estate
-  Attract CGT when assets are eventually sold by trust
### The role of trusts in estate planning
-  Trust plays an important role in financial planning and effectively used to protect assets
-  Trusts separate the ownership of asset -  allows benefit & use of assets
-  Separate growth assets from your estate -  reduce dutiable value of estate & shift eventual CGT to trust
-  Trust is created by written contract – Trust deed
	- Inter Vivos Trust – during founders lifetime
	- Testamentary Trust – established by will or death
-  Nature of Assets clearly specified and transferred to Trust by – donation, sale or other mechanism
-  At least one beneficiary to the trust
#### Types of trusts
“Determine how ownership of the assets vests & rights of beneficiaries”
-  `Bewind Trusts` -  beneficiaries given ownership but administered and controlled by Trustee of those assets (minors reach certain age)
-  `Discretionary Trusts` -  Trustees determine extent & nature of benefits to beneficiaries (protection of minors or improvident beneficiaries)
-  `Vesting Trusts` – provide for specific rights for beneficiaries to income or capital derived from trust assets
#### The role of the trustee
-  Trustee – appropriate & efficient administration of Trusts assets
-  Appointment approved by Master of High Court
-  No restriction on the minimum age or qualifications of the trustee (so it may be a family member or minor)
-  The trust document may specify criteria to be fulfilled by the trustees before they may be appointed, and these must be complied with.
-  Trustees duties & responsibilities governed by legal provisions
-  Professionals (lawyers or accountants) & some family members (anticipate need of beneficiaries)
-  Duties & responsibilities of Trustees
-  Act with due diligence care & skill – carrying out terms and stipulations of Trust contract
-  Open a separate Trust bank account and administer assets
-  Conserve & protect property of trust
-  Clear in all financial transactions act benefit of trust and not on personal basis
-  Retain all documentation – assets owned & administered within trust for 5 years after termination of trust
-  Trustee act in good faith – benefit of beneficiaries – account to beneficiaries on a regular basis
-  Trustee remunerated – only what they are entitled to
#### The benefits of trusts
-  Trusts allow for growing assets to be separated from dutiable estate – reduce burden of estate duty
-  Trusts allow protection of assets – separate ownership from benefits of assets
	-  No attachment of assets by creditors
-  Trusts provides for succession of beneficiary interests in assets of trust
	-  On death of one beneficiary passed on to other beneficiaries
-  Trust limits liability of the beneficiaries of trust – not liable for any liabilities of trust
-  Trust provides protection of beneficiaries interests such as minors or improvident persons
#### Shortcomings of trusts
-  Duties of trustees are onerous and trustees are personally liable for breach of duty or good faith in execution of duties
-  Can lead to conflicts between Trustees and Beneficiaries
-  Trusts are expensive to administer where professionals appointed
	-  For small estates professionals are not recommended
-  Transfer of property to the trust can be costly (at 8 %)
	-  This increased subsequently to 20% of assets transferred up to R30m
	-  Sec 64(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act
#### Tax implications of Trusts
-  Income earned by Trust – income for trust if retained within trust
-  When distributed to beneficiaries – taxed in their hands
-  Same for Capital Gains Tax (CGT)
-  If Trust distributes income to beneficiaries in accrual year – Trust is conduit & income accrues to beneficiary
-  Trust earns dividends & interest income – distributes to beneficiaries – beneficiaries qualify for dividend and interest exemptions
