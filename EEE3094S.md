# Systems
Systems are objects or processes that transform signals.
In control engineering, “the system” could refer to:
- part of the thing 
- the thing we’re trying to control 
- the combination of the thing and the controller

A system is an input-output relationship between signals.
# [[Block diagrams]]
## Linear and Time-Invariant (LTI) systems: 
only need to know the response to one signal to fully define the system.

#### Homegeneity
Scaled input results in an output scaled by the same amount

#### Additivity
Sum of inputs = sum of individual responses of the inputs

$$
ax_1(t) + bx_2(t) → ay_1(t) + by_2(t)
$$

#### Time Invariance
time-shifting the input causes the same shift in the response.
$$
x(t − λ) → y(t − λ)
$$


# Dynamic Systems
- system that can be modelled using differential equations in time.

If you wanted velocity instead of position you'd just need to relate the equation in terms of velocity and like wise for acceleration
$$
m\dot{v}(t) = -bv(t) - k\int{v(t)} + F(t)
$$
## Dynamic Response

## Steady State Response
- This is the equilibrium reached after a system is disrupted by an input
- It follows the shape of the input (i.e. the steady state depends on what the input looks like)

- The ability to track a particular type of setpoint is related to how many integrators there are in the loop.
- type number = number of integrators in the loop path of a system
- For perfect tracking, the type number must match the order of the setpoint.
- Type 1 for step, 2 for ramp and 3 for a parabola input.
- type number correction = adding integrators in the loop path.
- Integrators any where in the loop will contribute to the type number
![[Disturbance_rejection.png]]
- Input disturbances cause the input that the plant receives to be different from the expected output of the controller.
- The output will be different than the value our model predicts. These discrepancies can be incorporated as output disturbances.
- The sensor that we use to measure the output will also be susceptible to noise.
- Increasing the loop gain reduces the effects of input and output disturbances but it does nothing for noise.

# First Order System
![[first_order_gain.png]]
# $$\frac{r}{s--\frac{1}{\tau}} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{L}^{-1}}  re^{-\frac{1}{\tau}t}u(t)$$
- where $r=\frac{A}{\tau}$
- The time constant determines the rate of decay of the time-domain exponential.

## TRANSIENT RESPONSE
- transient response = part of the response that decays away over time
- transient response = impulse response
- Poles in the left-half plane (negative poles) are stable.
- Poles in the right-half plane (positive poles) are unstable.
- Poles on the axis (real part = 0) are marginally stable.
	- The sinusoid doesn’t decay to zero over time, but it is bounded since it isn’t growing to infinity, either.

$$
x(0) = \lim_{x\to\infty} sx(s) \hspace{20mm} x(\infty) = \lim_{x\to0} sx(s)
$$

$y_{ss}$ is the steady state value

### $2^{nd}$ Order Transfer Functions
Overdamped:              Two real distinct poles
Critically damped:      Two real identical poles
Underdamped:            A pair of complex poles

# Bode Plots
$$
\begin{align*}
G &= G_1\cdot G_2 \cdot ... \cdot G_n\\
\log|G| &= \log|G_1|\cdot \log|G_2|\cdot ... \cdot \log|G_n|\\
\angle{G} &= \angle{G_1}\cdot \angle{G_2}\cdot ... \angle{G_n}
\end{align*}
$$
If you have a product of transfer functions they just add in the decibel scale
