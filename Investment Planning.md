- Involves the evaluation and selection of appropriate investment assets based on the investor’s time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals. Example of financial goals are:
	- To be financially secure on retirement.
	- To provide for children’s college/university education.
	- To create a “rainy day” reserve.
	- To acquire a new house or raise a deposit for a new house.
- The term investment refers to either:
	- The saving of current income for a period of time in exchange for a return that compensate for the opportunity cost of not spending now, risk and inflation; or
	- Assets, goods or commodities purchased today to be used in future/at the time of crisis; or
	- Simply using money to make more money. 
# Types of Investments
- An individual can invest in any of the following investment types:
###### Financial investments (direct and indirect investment):
-Money market investments: Fixed deposits (Bank deposits & savings a/c, NCDs and T-bills).
- Bonds. (government or corporate)
- Shares/stocks/equities.
- Mutual funds/managed funds/collective investments.
- Futures, options and foreign currencies. Derivatives.
###### Non-financial investments (direct and indirect investment):
- Real estate (residential or commercial property). `Recommended`
- Collectibles (art, antiques, gems and jewellery)
- Alternative assets: commodities and precious metals (e.g. gold and silver). 
# Reasons for Investments
###### WHY AM I INVESTING?
The answer to this question partly helps determine what type of investment you should engage in.
- For income?
	- means buying investments that are expected to give you regular returns without the principal increasing in value over time.
	- At what stage in the FLC would this objective be a priority? Retirement or preseration stage
	- Examples of such investments are: Money markets investments( fixed deposits, savings accounts). Bonds
- For growth (capital gain)?
	- Investing for growth means buying investments that are expected to increase in value over time. (e.g. collectibles) Such investments should ideally be made at the accumulation stage of the FLC
- For both income and growth?
	- For example: Investment in shares with a low dividend yield where income is re-invested into the company to generate future growth.

###### THE NEED FOR INVESTMENT PLANNING.
- “failing to plan, planning to fail”.
- Helps in knowing where you are and where you want to go in terms of your personal and family financial goals and helps you get there by helping you make wise choices regarding savings and investments.
- Investment planning helps you know your goals, your budget and your risk tolerance.
- Helps avoid hazardous detours, like get-rich-quick schemes, which delay or stop your progress.
- Investment planning controls an individual’s spending patterns and ensures that all your financial dreams become a reality.
- Deciding how and what amount to invest ensures an individual of having sufficient money for the future. 
# INVESTMENT RISK AND RETURNS
- Most of the investment there is a trade-off between risk and return.
- The greater the risk, the larger the return investors require as compensation for bearing that risk
- `Higher risk` means less certainty or `greater volatility`.
- In order to make an investment, investors require compensation (i.e. a return) for:
	- The opportunity cost of not spending the money now. Interest
	- The uncertainty of the payment in future (RISK).
	- The expected rate of price-rise (INFLATION). 
![[risk_vs_return.png]]
# Investment Returns
- A return is a benefit an investor receives from an investment, expressed as a percentage and usually calculated over a period of one year.
- The total holding period return on an investment (also known as the return on shareholder investment - ROSI) consist of two components:
	- Capital gains (or losses) - Arising from price changes.
	- Investment income - Being dividends, interest, or rent received.
- The total holding period return on any investment (e.g. a share) is calculated as follows:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Total holding period return (or ROSI)} &= \frac{[(P_1 - P_0) + D] \times 100}{P_0}\\
\text{Capital gains yield} &= \frac{P_1-P_0}{P_0}\times 100\\
\text{Dividend yield} &= \frac{D}{P_0}\times 100
\end{align*}
$$
- Where:
	- $P_1$ is price end of the period.
	- $P_0$ is price at the beginning of the period.
	- D is the investment income received during the period. 
#### ARITHIMETIC MEAN/AVERAGE RETURN.
- The average return provides an indication of how the investment performed, on average, over each year of the investment period.
- FORMULA for calculating arithmetic mean (average) return is:
$$
r_A = \frac{[R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n]}{n}
$$
- The arithmetic mean is appropriate where the annual returns are independent of each other, often not the case in finance.
- The arithmetic mean ignores compounding of returns from one year to the next. 
#### Nominal versus real returns
- `Nominal rates` of return are actual returns earned on an investment before adjusting for inflation.
- `Real returns` are investment returns that have been adjusted for inflation. This is obtained by subtracting inflation rate during the investment period from the nominal rate of return for that period.
#### RISK: MEANING AND MEASUREMENT.
- Risk refers to the degree of uncertainty or variability (volatility) in year-to-year returns on an investment.
- The volatility of returns (risk) on an investment is measured by the standard deviation (as a percentage).
- The more dispersed the returns on an investment are over time, the more volatile that investment is and the higher the standard deviation will be.
- Remember: The greater the risk, the greater the return and the lower the risk, the lower the return.
![[cumulative_returns.png]]
# INVESTMENT ETHICS
- Remember that there is a trade-off between the potential return on an investment and its risk.
- The higher the risk on an investment, the higher its expected return. Because of this law:
	- Investment advisors promising clients excessively high returns with “no risk” should be treated with extreme caution.
###### Ponzi Schemes - Charles Ponzi
- Returns not paid from profits earned, but from money deposited by subsequent investors.
- Requires an increasing flow of funds from new investors to keep the scheme going.
# Investment Risk & Return
###### RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS
When evaluating the performance of investments or choosing the better performing investment:
- It is necessary to compare investments not only to other risky investments, but also to risk-free investments. This is done on a risk-adjusted basis.
- It must be stressed that investments should never be compared on the basis of only risk or only returns. Any comparisons must reflect both aspects of investment performance (risk and return).
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Risk-adjusted return} &= \frac{\text{Risk Premium}}{\text{Standard deviation}}\\
\text{Risk-adjusted return} &= \frac{(\text{Return} - \text{Risk-free rate})}{\text{Standard deviation}}\\
R_{AR} &= \frac{R_A-R_{fr}}{\sigma}
\end{align*}
$$
## Portfolios
- A collection/group of assets held by an investor (e.g. retail shares, mining shares, bonds, T-bills).
- Diversification is a portfolio strategy designed to reduce risk by combining a variety of investments, such as shares, bonds, mutual funds, real estate, which are unlikely to move in the same direction.
- The goal of diversification is to reduce portfolio risk. Diversification works on the principle: "Not putting all your eggs in one basket"
- Diversification is best achieved when the returns of assets in a portfolio move in an opposite direction - when returns are negatively correlated.
#### Portfolio Diversification
- Correlation between investment returns must be low (negative) in order to achieve maximum diversification.
![[portfolio_correlation.png]]
It should be noted that there is a limit to diversification due to:
- `Market risk`: A component of total risk (SD) that cannot be reduced through diversification. Only unique risk is reduced.
- Benefits of diversification become incrementally smaller as you add more assets to your portfolio.
- The costs of diversification (there are costs associated with buying assets).
![[diversification_vs_risk.png]]
##### Strategies
###### Active Revision
- This strategy involves frequent changes in an existing portfolio over a certain period of time for maximum returns and minimum risks. `More expensive, requires extensive research`
###### Passive Revision
- This strategy involves rare changes in portfolio and only under certain predetermined rules called formula plans.
- According to passive revision strategy, a portfolio manager can bring changes in the portfolio as per the formula plans only. `Cheaper`
##### THE FLC AND INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES
###### Accumulation Phase:
- Building wealth (capital accumulation).
- Little focus on financial risk.
- Interested in capital appreciation (re-investment).
- Long-term investments.
###### Consolidation Phase:
- Increased focus on capital preservation.
- Lower risk investments.
###### Preservation Phase:
- New wealth comes from appreciation in value of income generated by existing assets.
- Capital protection.
- Favour income generating assets.
##### INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS AND PITFALLS:
1. Have realistic goals and needs.
2. Its important to have cash reserves.
3. Avoid mental accounting - view all your investments as part of a single overall portfolio.
4. Re-evaluate investment objectives and rebalance your portfolio.
5. Accurately determine your investment horizon.
6. Do not speculate!!!...you cannot beat the market!
7. Consider inflation.
8. Consider the relationship between your age and risk tolerance.
9. Consider your risk tolerance
10. Be aware of the degree of liquidity of your investments? Ease with which you can convert the investment into cash
11. Avoid the “fear-greed” cycle - so that you do not buy high and sell low.
# Investment Planning B
# Financial Markets
- Financial markets, are markets where financial assets (instruments or securities) are traded (bought and sold).
- Examples of financial markets are: Money markets, capital markets, foreign exchange markets and derivatives markets.
- Most investment planning for individuals occur within capital and money markets.
#### Money markets (MM):
- Are financial markets where short-term debt instruments (with maturities of less than one year) are traded.
- Money markets instruments: Have short-term maturities, have lower risk (`interest and original amount are guaranteed`) and lower returns when compared to capital markets instruments.
- Good for short- to medium-term investment. Suitable at what phase of the PFLC? `Suitable at the preservation phase`.
- Examples of money markets instruments are: Government treasury bills, NCDs(`Negotiable Certificate of Deposit`, fixed deposit and money market accounts.
# Money Markets
### Fixed Deposit Accounts:
- You deposit a lump-sum amount with a bank at a fixed interest rate and you cannot access the money for a pre-specified period of time (e.g. 24 months).
- Lack of access to money in a fixed deposit account make them not to be liquid. However, returns tend to be higher than for more flexible MM accounts (e.g., savings accounts).
- With the fixed interest rate, you benefit if interest rates in the market decrease and loose if market interest rates increase. 
### Money Market (MM) Accounts:
- Are types of bank deposit accounts that pay higher interest rates (than savings accounts) but require higher minimum deposits (higher deposits attract higher interest rates).
- Unlike fixed deposits, money invested in MM accounts is available on demand. However, the large minimum deposits required are a barrier to investment by many individual investors. 
# Capital Markets
#### Capital Markets:
- Are financial markets that facilitate trade in shares (equities or stocks) and long-term debt (bonds).
- The JSE Main Board (for shares) and the BESA (for bonds) are examples of capital markets.
- Capital markets instruments have higher risk and offer higher returns than money markets instruments and are long-term investments.
Capital market are comprised of primary and secondary markets.
- The Primary Markets:
	- Are financial markets where new shares and bonds are sold by companies (and governments) to investors for the first time (e.g. via an IPO). `Initial public offering - when a company gets listed on an exchange`.
	- Are financial markets where companies/governments raise finance via the issuing of shares and bonds.
- The Secondary Markets:
	- Enable owners of shares and bonds (shareholders & bondholders) to sell their securities to other investors.
	- Provide a value (price) for securities already issued, thus increasing the marketability and liquidity of the securities.
	- Stockbrokers: Bring together buyers and sellers of shares and bonds (in a secondary market) for a fee (matchmaking) and bear no risk of ownership of the securities. `Also provide investment advice to clients`.
	- Dealers: Buy securities in their own right and sell from their own securities inventory. Hence they bear the price risk - incur loss if share price decrease..
- Is the JSE Securities Exchange a primary or secondary market? `It is both, although it operates mainly as a secondary market`. 
#### ORDINARY SHARES.
- Are the most common type of shares that companies issue when they raise capital.
- Unlike bonds, shares represents an ownership interest in the company and shareholders are entitled to: voting rights (at the AGM) and dividends (when declared).
- Return on ordinary share investment comprise dividends and capital gain (or loss).
- Dividend payment is not guaranteed (unlike interest): Young and growing Cos pay little or no dividends.
- `Advantages`: Long-term, they outperform bonds and MM instruments, easy to buy and sell (if listed), information is easily available (annual reports and prices), hundreds of companies to choose from.
- `Disadvantages`: Risk is higher than that of bonds and MM instruments. Dividends are not guaranteed and you could loose the original investment
#### BONDS
- Are financial securities issued by companies, governments or municipalities when they want to raise debt finance/capital.
	- Unlike loans, bonds are traded in the financial markets.
	- Examples include: government bonds, corporate and fixed interest bonds.
	- They are usually issued at face value (also known as par or nominal value).
- Bond issuers have an obligation to pay bondholders (a) fixed interest amount (or coupons) either annually or semi-annually; and (b) the face value at the end of a fixed maturity date.
	- Hence, they are ideal for investors who desire current income and capital preservation.
- The return on a bond comprise coupon payments & capital gain.
- Bond prices change on a daily basis largely due to changes in interest rates in the market.
	- When market interest rates decrease, bond prices increase and vice versa.
	- Bonds are susceptible to interest rate risk and credit (default) risks.
##### HOW CAPITAL MARKET INVESTMENTS ARE TRADED.
- The shares of SA listed companies are traded on one of the two divisions of the JSE: the Main Board & the Alternative Exchange.
	- The Main Board: Caters for larger, established and more liquid companies.
	- The ALTX: Caters for small, new companies that are less liquid.
- The JSE lists shares for trade and provides data on share prices and share (stock) market indices.
- A stock market index is a measure of stock market performance - whether share prices have, on average, moved up or down.
	- Indices are constructed for the entire market (e.g. the JSE All Share Index) or for a segment of the market (e.g. Industrials Index or the Top 40 Index).
	- When an index has gone down on a day, it means that overall, the shares in that index had a negative capital return (showing a general price decrease).
- The purchase or sell of JSE listed shares is done through a JSE registered stockbroker. Stockbrokers also provide (at a fee):
	- Discretionary services: Make decisions on your behalf (pre-defined terms).
	- Non-discretionary services: They provide advice, you make decisions
##### THE COST OF INVESTING:
- There are a number of costs involved with transactions with the stockbroker (buying and selling of shares).
	- The smaller your investment, the greater the impact of transaction costs.
	- The more frequently you change your portfolio, the more investment returns are eroded by transaction costs.
##### DIRECT AND INDIRECT INVESTMENTS:
- Investing in individual shares (i.e. direct investment) by an individual investor, comes with the following disadvantages:
	- It can be costly (expensive) especially for small investments(given transaction fees incurred).
	- It requires technical skills to be able to pick shares that suit the investor’s financial goals. Most individual investors lack such skills.
	- The JSE restrict the purchase of shares to lots of 100 - making share investments out of reach for many ordinary investors, given high share prices
- Given the disadvantages of investing in individual shares, many investors entrust the management of their investment portfolios to professionals or ‘active fund managers’. Unit trusts are an E.G.
- Unit trusts are created when a company pools funds from many investors in order to invest in shares listed on the JSE. Unit trusts:
	- Enable small-time investors to gain access to investment in expensive blue-chip shares like BAT or SABMiller. This may not be possible on their own.
	- Give you access to a diversified portfolio, the fund invests in shares across many sectors. 
##### DIRECT AND INDIRECT INVESTMENTS:
- Although there are significant advantages of investing in unit trusts, there are also disadvantages.
- Disadvantages of unit trusts include the following:
	- They attract significant management and administration fees due to the fact that the funds are ‘actively managed’.
	- Fund managers do not always have the skills necessary to outperform the market and generate superior returns. Research shows that they underperform the market after taking into account the fees they charge..
##### CAPITAL MARKET HISTORY:
- Different investments have different risks and rates of returns.
- A SA study, covering the period 1900-2010 (110 years), examined the risks and returns on the following three financial assets:
	- A portfolio of ordinary shares.
	- A portfolio of long-term governments bonds.
	- A portfolio of three-month money market instruments (cash deposits & TBs).
- Given that historically, investment in ordinary shares was the best overall, why would anybody invest in the other two asset classes?
	- Risk averse.
	- Concerned about steady income and capital preservation.
	- When investing for the short-term.
- Table 12.2 from the SA study also shows that:
	- Ordinary shares had the greatest variability (risk), maximum return of 107.7% in 1933 and a minimum of -29.6% in 1920.
	- Money market investments had the least variability, maximum return of 21.8% in 1985 and a minimum of 0.0% in 1934-1936 and 1938-1947.
	- Government bonds were mildly variable, maximum return of 35.9% and a minimum of -10.7%.
- The study also shows that the higher the volatility (risk or standard deviation) the higher the return and vice versa.
