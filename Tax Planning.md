## Tax cycle and types of individual taxpayers
- Tax period for individuals annually - 1 March to 28 February
- Business however determine their own financial year
- The Tax Cycle:
	- At the end of the year registered tax payer required by law to submit a tax return either manually (22 October 2023) or electronically (16 November 2023)
	- Use a standard form – detailing all forms of income (taxable and non-taxable) and deductions claimed
	- After receiving the tax return - SARS calculates the tax liability and sends out an Assessment notice
	- Informing the taxpayer whether he owes SARS or not or and date to settle
	- New system introduced this year Pre-assessed – agree with the net tax liability calculated by SARS or not.
- 2 Classes of individual tax payers
	- Non-Provisional and Provisional
- Cycle is different - `NON-PROVISIONAL`
	- Non-provisional taxpayers pay tax on a weekly / monthly basis from wages and salaries
	- Employers are required by law to deduct Standard Income Tax On Employees (SITE) and Paye-As-You-Earn (PAYE)
	- Computerised Tax tables & packages make it easier and more accurate
	- Non-provisional complete one tax return / assessment for the year
- `PROVISIONAL`
	- Provisional taxpayers DO NOT pay tax on a weekly / monthly basis OR regular basis
	- Complete tax returns twice a year – 31 August and 28 February together with monetary payments
	- $1^{st}$ return on 31 August – 50% of the ESTIMATED tax for the full year (Tax estimate > BASIC AMOUNT*)
	- $2^{nd}$ return on 28 February – ESTIMATE for full period less 50%
		- Must be 90% or more of the total ACTUAL FUTURE TAX LIABILITY
	- Both payments based on ESTIMATES – might be $3^{rd}$ payment
- The first payment is based on the first assessment, and is supposed to be half of the estimated tax for the full year.
- The second payment has a two (2) tier system depending on the taxpayer’s taxable income:
- Actual taxable income of R1 million or less:
- To avoid any penalty the basic amount may be used. If a lower estimate is used, this must be within 90% of the taxable income finally assessed.
- Actual taxable income more than R1 million:
- To avoid any penalty the estimate amount must be 80% of the taxable income excluding retirement fund lump sums, finally assessed.
- If Requirements are not met, a penalty of 20% is levied on the difference between the estimated tax and 90% of the Actual tax (where the taxable income is R1 million or less), or 80% of the Actual tax (where the taxable income exceeds R1million).
# Capital Gains Tax (CGT) (introduced in 2001)
- Only consider asset sales
- Capital gains tax is payable when an asset is sold for more than its Base cost
- Base cost is original amount paid for asset
	- If you acquired an asset before 2001 - Base cost would be what the value was on 1 October 2001
- For example bought a beach house:
$$1996 – \text{R}130 000 \text{ }\hspace{10mm} 1 \text{ Oct 2001} – \text{R}420 000$$
- If sold house for R1 800 000
- Capital Gain would be R1 800 000 – 420 000 = R1 380 000
- Exempt R2m if Primary residence 16
## Disposal exempt from CGT
- Most important exclusion is primary residence
- If primary residence is sold for less than R2 million no CGT
- If primary residence is sold for more than R2m then 1st R2m is CGT free
- ONLY APPLICABLE TO INDIVIDUALS (NATURAL PERSONS)
- Assets for personal use are exempt from CGT (cars, furniture, electronics & jewellery)
- Exceptions are shares and gold coins
- Exemption disposals are lump sums received from pensions, provident & annuities
- Annual exclusion for individuals is R40 000 (2020: R30 000)
## Calculating the amount subject to CGT

## Trading versus non trading assets
- Assets that are bought and sold on a regular basis considered to be Trading assets therefore
	- All profits are included in taxable income and taxed at standard rates
- Note CGT only include 40% of NET capital gain and maximum tax rate at 45%. Therefore the maximum tax is 40% x 45% = 18%
- Whereas the full amount is taxable if trading in the assets.
	- For example if shares are held for 3 or more years – Investment and subject to CGT rules
	- However if you trade (Buy and sell) in shares then the income is subject to normal income tax rules
# Computing Taxable income and tax liability
1. Determine total (Gross) income
2. Deduct income that is tax-exempt (not taxable) (Section 10)
3. Deduct allowable tax deductions (items that reduce the taxable income and hence tax liability) (Section 11)
4. Add all taxable capital gains after applying the inclusion rate
5. Deduct S18A Donations
6. Apply tax rates to the taxable income obtained
7. Subtract applicable tax rebates (Primary and Medical) to determine final tax liability
8. Subtract 6 from Employees Tax Paid already to determine:
	1. liability (7 > Tax paid) – You owe SARS (a liability)
	2. or refund (7 < Tax paid) – SARS owes you (an asset)
## Determine total (Gross) income
