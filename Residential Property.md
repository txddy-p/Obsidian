### Considerations when buying a property
- `Affordability` - Bond repayments, maintenance, security, insurance, municipal accounts,
- `Initial expenses` - Transfer fees and bond costs, moving & storage costs
- `Location`
	- Buying into an area: schools, live close to work, near highways
	- Negative factors: Noisy freeways, sport stadiums, unoccupied buildings, poor lighting
	- Shops in wealthier areas more expensive impacts on living expenses
- `New or old neighbourhood` - “neighbourhoods reflect demographics in terms of age”
	- Old (established): likely to have all facilities like shops, schools, transport, more security, good neighbourhood security watches
	- New: attracts etc investment in shops, malls, petrol stations
- `Lifestyle and Flexibility` - Lifestyle considerations: Features (design) of home – Kitchen, swimming pool & gardens
- `Aesthetic values (addition)` - Environment, tranquility 5
### Buying versus renting
- Renting is not inferior to buying? Rents are low? Western Cape are very high resulting in high vacancy rates.
- Landlord has to maintain outside & tenant inside (Lease agreement)
- Easier to move than to sell a house? Depends on lease agreement t & c’s
- Both have risks:
	- Renting - Increase rentals and possible eviction (court order takes up to 3 months)
	- Buying - Increased interest rates: possible default & loss of home
### Building versus buying
- Building: `Advantages`: build features (requirements-kitchen, bathroom, swimming pool, walk in cupboards, downlights) to your requirements (taste).
- Buy: Existing houses have established gardens, space
	- Defects in houses: cracks, leaks, damp & electrical faults
	- Therefore inspect the house thoroughly – clear & hot day.
	- Make a check list
- Buy: Legal costs (Transfer & bond costs)
- Renovation: Time & expertise could be stressful and expensive

### Drivers of Property prices (Macro, property cycle & micro)
#### Macro factors
Supply & demand: Higher demand $\rightarrow$ lower supply $\rightarrow$ higher price
- `The economy` - State of the economy: boom employment is up, more money and confidence is good
- `Interest rates` - Higher rates – decline in demand what is the current prime rate? Nice MCQ question!
- `Building costs` - Plans (5% of building costs), Heritage costs (R300), Costs of labour & materials and Engineers.
### The Property Cycle
- Driven by supply & demand
- Good times property prices increase
-  More investment by developers – supply increases
-  But when interest rates increases? Oversupply and prices falls?
	- Properties stay on market for long periods…prices drop
-  Gut feel depends on area
-  So always invest in an established area
-  Look at plans submitted to municipalities for information regarding supply of new properties in future
### Micro Factors
- `Location`
	- Access to school, highways, & other facilities
	- Buy cheapest (run down house) in good neighbourhood
	- Beware of over capitalisation (spending too much on renovations/ alterations– look at average values in the area)
- `Availability of land (non reproductive asset)`
	- Population growth, migration & employment opportunities increase demand for housing & land – Western Cape
- `Condition`
	- Newly renovated home will sell for more than neglected one!
	- Painting and Landscaping contributes to considerable increase in value
### Valuing a property
-  Property values are highly subjective
-  Check out from:
	- Council what amounts local properties were sold for
	- Estate agents (asking prices may be overstated – negotiation)
- Estate agents want to sell as high as possible for commission
	- Newspapers – property guide
	- New sources: Internet, Facebook
	- Established neighbourhoods as from new ones
	- Factors to determine market value: Erf size, rooms, age, location, close to amenities, view (BoKaap), security..
## Mechanics of buying and selling a residential property
### The role players
##### The Estate agent
- Open mandate: any estate agent can find a buyer
- Multi-listing mandate: the main estate agent involves other estate agents
- Sole mandate: even if seller finds a buyer estate agent will receive the commission (check terms & conditions carefully)
##### Attorneys (Conveyancers)
- Nominated by the seller as property & mortgage must be legally registered
- Administration – Council (rates clearance), SARS (transfer duty), Bank, Deeds Office
- 3 Attorneys – transferring, buyer’s new bond registration & cancellation of seller’s existing bond 4
##### The Bank
- Assessment of applicant to determine credit worthiness
- Security (collateral) – property itself
- Bank like your business as it increases their profits
##### Home loan originators
- Serve as intermediaries to get the best & cheapest interest rate
- Earn commissions from banks
### Physical occupation
- Transfer can take 3 months without any snags 
- Date of occupation by buyer & transfer of ownership never coincide
- Buyer occupies property – seller legal owner
	- Seller continues payments – utilities? & bond
- To address imbalance in costs & benefits
	- Buyer pays a monthly occupational rent to seller
	- Or seller stays on Occupational rent to buyer
## Costs
##### Sellers costs
-  Agents commission (5% of property selling price)
-  Compliance certificates, electrical, beetle, rates clearance?
-  Rates and taxes: up to 4 months in advance
-  Bond cancellation fees: around (R1 500 to R2 000)
-  Capital gains tax (CGT)
##### Buyers costs
-  Council, rates clearance?
-  Transfer duties – SARS this must be paid before transfer of ownership can occur at the Deeds Office.
	- See the table on page 15 for the transfer duty applicable to the different selling prices of property.
-  Attorneys costs- Bond registration and transfer of ownership
## Financing property purchases
#### How mortgages work 
- Amortisation loans: 20 years, 240 monthly instalments, interest rates can differ (negotiate) and linked to repo rate (3.5%).
- Advice is to always have a cushion – Take loan at say 10% but can afford repayments at 12% - 1 4% .
#### The impact of key mortgage variables (page 16)
- Interest & Period on R100 000 loan for 20 years (240 months)
![[mortgage_variables.png]]
- Paying back the loan in 10 years as opposed to 20 years.
![[10_year_mortgage.png]]
- Access bonds: as the borrower pays off the loan, the money becomes available to lend again.
Interest as percentage of Total
`Banks use Loan to Value ratio (LTV) to evaluate loan applications`
### Loan-to-value ratio
$$
\text{LTV} = \frac{\text{Balance of mortgage loan}}{\text{Market value of property}}
$$
Two important points to note.
- The higher the LTV ratio the bigger the loan relative to the value of the property:
	- Offered to better & lower risk customers.
	- But will require lower LTV for less creditworthy clients
- The loan balance decreases over time & property value increases therefore the LTV ratio will decrease.
### Refinancing
Bond refinancing is the replacement of a current mortgage loan with a new one (lower rate or better terms).
##### Purpose
- Is to free up money from home loan or
- Save money by changing to a new home loan at a lower rate
- Additional costs can be high unless compensated for by lower new lower interest rates and administration costs
- Refinancing should not be done when loan is nearly paid off!
- Purchase price: R400 000 and a loan of R300 000
	- LTV = 0.75 (R300 000/400 000)
- Today value of house is R650 000 and bond balance is R240 000
	- LTV = 0.37 (R240 000/650 000)
- Wants a LTV ratio of 0.60 (R390 000 / 650 000) and borrows R390 000 and;
	- repays R240 000 and has cash left of R150 000?
- Additional costs and can be financially unsound if original loan is close to repayment date
## Flipping
- Find a property under market value; Fix (upgrade) it and; Sell at a profit.
- Very difficult to do with expensive properties as you need large amounts of cash flows
###### 10 mistakes of flipping
1. Lie on loan applications
2. Overpaid for property
3. Lacked cash to upgrade
4. Quit his day job
5. Hired unlicensed contractor
6. Bought property unseen
7. Bought out of province property
8. Bought too many properties
9. Underestimated the upgrade costs
10. Poor exit strategy (partners)
