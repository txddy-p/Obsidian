# DSP
A discrete-time signal is represented as a sequence of numbers:
$$x = {x[n]}, −∞ < n < ∞.$$

Here n is an integer, and $x[n]$ is the nth sample in the sequence.
Discrete-time signals are often obtained by sampling continuous-time signals.
## The unit sample sequence
is defined as
$$
δ[n] =\begin{cases}
0&n\neq0\\
1&n=0
\end{cases}
$$
An important aspect of the impulse sequence is that an arbitrary sequence can be represented as a sum of scaled, delayed impulses
$$
x[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}x[k]\delta[n-k]
$$
## The unit step sequence
is defined as
$$
u[n] =\begin{cases}
1&n\geq0\\
0&n<0
\end{cases}
$$
This is a right sided step. It is basically a sum of impulses
$$
u[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{n}\delta[k]
$$
