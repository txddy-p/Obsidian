# Week 1
Lee, on behalf of their employer (based in Cape Town), purchased equipment from an online supplier (head office in Gauteng). When the goods arrived, not only was the wrong amount delivered but several of the goods were damaged. Lee calculates that to rectify the
situation will cost R50 000. When Lee contacted the online supplier, she was told to check the Terms & Conditions which had been agreed to when the order was placed. In terms of the Ts & Cs, the supplier takes no responsibility for goods damaged in transit, and any possible claims must be brought in Gauteng. Lee needs to find out what the law says about this situation and to understand the process and steps that need to be taken to remedy the loss.

## What we need to determine:
1. The correct legal category for the problem
	- We call this the ‘cause of action’
	- I.e. what is the legal basis of the claim / problem (cause of action)?
2. The correct avenue/route for remedying the dispute
	- We say: which court, tribunal or body has ‘jurisdiction’?
Let’s return to our scenario
1. Into what legal category does the claim fall?
2. Which law or laws apply?
3. Which court, tribunal or body has jurisdiction?
- Value of ADR if permissible/available?
# Week 2
## Transactions made without consent
### Example.
Jill and John are married ICOP. John sold some jewellery (buyer - jewellery collector) which Jill inherited from her grandmother. They keep it as a capital asset. John did not have Jill’s consent to sell the jewellery and he knew that she would never consent.
ADD (1):
ADD (2): value of the jewellery is R10 000 – sold for R6 000.

## Marriages Out of Community of Property (OCOP) & Marriages Out of Community of Property with the Accrual (Accrual)
### Example:
Let’s illustrate the calculation of the accrual with an example. Suppose John and Mary got married in 2000 and decided to get divorced in 2023. At the commencement of their marriage in 2000, John’s net estate was valued at ZAR 1,500,000, and Mary’s net estate was valued at ZAR 2,000,000. At the dissolution of their marriage in 2023, John’s net estate was valued at ZAR 4,000,000, and Mary’s net estate was valued at ZAR 3,000,000.
John’s accrual = ZAR 4,000,000 – ZAR 1,500,000 = ZAR 2,500,000
Mary’s accrual = ZAR 3,000,000 – ZAR 2,000,000 = ZAR 1,000,000
Since Mary’s accrual is smaller, she is entitled to claim half of the difference between the two accruals from John, which is ZAR 750,000.

## Effect Of An Unassisted Contract under the Common Law
### Example 1
Tebogo (16) buys a second-hand motorbike from John, a retired teacher and stay at home grandfather for R55000. Tebogo hides the motorbike at a friend’s house and her parents never see her use it and they don’t know about it.
One day Tebogo has an accident on the bike. Thankfully, she is fine, but the bike is a total write off, just a lump of crushed metal.
Obviously at this point, Tebogo’ s parents discover what has happened.
