Lee, on behalf of their employer (based in Cape Town), purchased equipment from an online supplier (head office in Gauteng). When the goods arrived, not only was the wrong amount delivered but several of the goods were damaged. Lee calculates that to rectify the
situation will cost R50 000. When Lee contacted the online supplier, she was told to check the Terms & Conditions which had been agreed to when the order was placed. In terms of the Ts & Cs, the supplier takes no responsibility for goods damaged in transit, and any possible claims must be brought in Gauteng. Lee needs to find out what the law says about this situation and to understand the process and steps that need to be taken to remedy the loss.

## What we need to determine:
1. The correct legal category for the problem
	- We call this the ‘cause of action’
	- I.e. what is the legal basis of the claim / problem (cause of action)?
2. The correct avenue/route for remedying the dispute
	- We say: which court, tribunal or body has ‘jurisdiction’?
