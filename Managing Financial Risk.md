# Speculative/Investment Risk Versus Pure Risk.
###### Speculative or Investment Risk:
- Has the possibility of earning a gain or incurring a loss.
- You may be happy to carry this risk because of a potential return (commensurate with the risk assumed).
###### Pure Risk:
- Has only the possibility of some loss occurring.
- Hence, unlike speculative risk, pure risk:
	- Has no upside benefit.
	- Is always undesirable. Speculative risk may be justified by the possibility of earning a gain.
- The management of risk depends on the need to:
	- Establish the probability or likelihood that the risk will occur.
	- Quantify the magnitude of the loss expected if the event occurs. 3
# Possible Methods of Dealing with Risk.
###### Risk Acceptance:
- The likelihood of loss attached to the risk is low or the magnitude of the potential loss is negligible.
- Hence its cheaper to ignore or just accept the risk.
###### Risk Reduction:
- Taking any action that may reduce either the: 
	 a. likelihood of a loss occurring; or 
	 b. magnitude or size of the loss.
###### Risk Avoidance:
- The possibility of loss is eliminated by taking appropriate steps or making significant changes in behaviour.
###### Risk Transfer:
- The risk of loss is transferred to another party, in exchange for a fee (the premium). This is the practice of insurance.
# Self-Insurance: Nature, Merits and Demerits.
- Is the practice of investing money in order to cover potential loss from specified risks. Ideal when:
	- One is unable to afford commercial insurance.
	- Started early in life so that the savings or investment grow sufficiently to cover potential future losses.
##### Advantages:
- Significantly cheaper than commercial insurance.
- The savings made remain your money, available to you, while premiums on commercial insurance are lost whether you subsequently claim or not.
##### Disadvantages:
- Any loss occurring is covered only to the extent of the current value of your savings/investment.
- A single loss may wipe out your entire self-insurance savings.
# What is #Insurance?
It is the practice of pooling of the risk of individuals or entities and enables the premiums paid to cover losses of the group.
## Categories of Insurance:
### Indemnity Insurance:
- Provides cover against loss in a specified amount.
- Seeks to restore the insured to the financial position before the event.
  Hence will never pay-out more than the actual value of the loss suffered.
- Examples include the following: motor vehicle insurance, household
  insurance and other short-term insurance contracts.
### Non-Indemnity Insurance:
- Provides cover related to the occurrence of a specific event whose timing is uncertain.
- Provides cover for a pre-specified amount that is not necessarily related to the loss suffered.
- An example is life insurance.
## Insurance Contract – Some general Points.
- The contract typically comprises of: the person being insured, the risk event covered, the period covered, the amount of compensation payable if event occurs & the premiums payable.
- The insured must have an insurable interest in the property or person insured – potential for suffering a loss if event occurs.
- The insured party is not always the beneficiary of the contract. This is the case with a life insurance contract.
- The insurance contract is a contract of ‘good faith’ between the insurer and insured. This means that the insured is obligated to disclose all the material facts to the insurer.
- The insurer has the right to cancel the contract or may refuse to pay any benefits if the insured has made:
	- Misrepresentations by omission (i.e., negative misrepresentation).
	- Misrepresentation by providing incorrect or false information (i.e., positive misrepresentation). 7
- Be careful of underinsurance.
	- This occurs when the insured takes out a cover for less than the value at risk.
	- In such a case, the ‘principle of averages’ is used to calculate the amount of compensation.
### Types of Insurance Contracts:
- The most relevant types of insurance contracts (from a personal finance view-point) are:
	- Insurance against damage to or loss of property arising from fire or flooding.
	- Death and disability cover (for death or injury to the insured).
	- Medical insurance contract – provides cover for hospital and other medical expenses.
#### Home Owner’s Insurance.
- Consists of two types:
- `Contents insurance`: Provides cover for losses due to theft of, or damage to, personal possessions within your home.
	- Available to both tenants and owners of the building.
- `Building insurance`: Provides cover for losses arising from damage to the structure of the home itself.
	- Available only to owners of buildings – insurable interest.
#### Contents Insurance:
- Comprise of two types:
- `Named perils insurance`: Provides cover against losses from events named or specified in the contract.
- `All-risk insurance`: Provides cover against all losses or damage to insured items, except for specified exclusions.
- Portable items (e.g. laptops and cell-phones) are:
	- Only covered by contents insurance or the named perils insurance while in the home specified in the contract.
	- Covered by the all-risk insurance contract or the portable possessions insurance contract when both inside or outside the home.
- The insurable value of your household contents must be based on replacement values (to be re-assessed at least annually).
- Contents insurance extends to your guests or relatives living with you (provided the insurable value includes their items).
- Most contents insurance policies include an excess clause.
	- This refers to a minimum loss threshold over which the insurer will pay-out your claim.
	- The excess clause aims to reduce: (1) the number of small claims made by the insured; and (2) the liability of, or cost to, the insurer.
- The premiums depend on the property’s location and security.
#### Building Insurance
- Provides cover against loss due to the damage to the structure of your home.
- It is a form of named perils insurance – covering acts of nature, fire and water damage.
- The insurable value should be based on replacement value and not the value of your bond (to be re-assessed continuously).
#### The Claims Process:
- Keep documents (invoices or photographs) away from the home, showing: proof of ownership, original purchase price and date of purchase.
- Immediately following the loss, notify your insurer and provide: a police report, case number and photographs of loss or damage.
- The insurer sends an assessor to investigate the extend of your loss or damage.
#### BUILDING INSURANCE: TIPS
##### Considerations When Obtaining Home-Owner’s Insurance:
- Shop around for the deal that best suits your requirements.
- Establish whether the insurer offer discounts for multiple policies (e.g. combining home-owner’s insurance and car insurance).
- Establish whether taking additional steps reduce your premiums (e.g. upgrading home security with burglar bars or alarms).
- Consider accepting a higher excess in exchange for a reduction in premiums.
- Maintain a good credit history.
- Avoid under-insurance by continuously re-assessing your replacement values.
#### CAR INSURANCE
- What are some of the costs of being involved in a car accident?
	- Personal injury and related medical costs.
	- Injury of passengers and related medical costs.
	- Injury to third parties and related medical costs. This could be significant.
	- Damage/loss of the car and the inconvenience of being without transport.
- Without an insurance policy the car-owner bears these costs.
- Most insurers in South Africa provide for either a comprehensive car insurance policy or a limited car insurance policy.
- A comprehensive car insurance provides cover against: theft, hijacking, damage due to accidents, fire or natural disasters (floods or hail) and 3rd party liability arising from an accident.
- A limited car insurance policy or “third party, fire and theft” insurance, provides cover against theft and hijacking, damage from fire and 3rd party liabilities, but not damage from accidents.
	- Lower premiums relative to comprehensive policies. 13
- In SA, 3rd party insurance is not compulsory for vehicle owners.
- Vehicle owners in SA are protected by the Road Accident Fund (RAF) from any 3rd party liabilities or claims arising from injury or death caused by road accidents.
- The RAF accepts 3rd party liabilities for damages to the people (and not the property) involved in road accidents.
	- Hence, vehicle owners are liable for any damage to the property of 3rd parties resulting from road accidents.
	- Without 3rd party insurance, the vehicle owner is personally liable for damage to the property of 3rd parties arising from road accidents.
- Its important to indicate to the insurer whether the vehicle if for business or personal use.
	- If used for business, premiums are higher given higher risk for theft or damage due to accidents.
	- Incorrect specification of vehicle usage may result in your claim being refused. 14
- The level of motor vehicle premiums is determined by:
	- The make and nature of the car.
	- Your risk profile.
	- The risk profile of the environment in which vehicle is used or kept.
	- The extent of the cover in the policy.
###### The insurable value of your vehicle may be based on:
- The retail value – the average price a dealer would sell the car for in the market, given its age, condition and mileage.
	- This gives you the highest insurable value, with higher premiums.
- The trade-in or book value – the average price you will receive for your vehicle from a dealer.
- The market value – the average of the retail and trade-in values.
	- It is lower than the retail value and carries lower premiums.
- Car insurance premiums tend to increase over time due to inflation and the number of claims made.
	- However, some insurers now offer incentives such as cash-back rewards for clients with limited or claim-free histories.
##### The Vehicle Accident Claim Process:
- Your claim is only valid for licensed vehicles that are road-worthy.
- At the accident scene:
	- Contact the police.
	- Exchange information with the other party: Name, address, license plate, insurance number.
	- Do not admit guilt or blame for the accident (insurer will deal with this).
	- Do not agree to have your vehicle be towed away without the consent of insurer.
	- If possible, take photos of the accident scene and the vehicles.
- Submit reports of the accident scene to the police and insurer.
- Provide the assessor (appointed by the insurer) with all the information required (including the photos taken at the scene).
	- The assessor’s report will help the insurer to decide whether to repair the vehicle or replace it (i.e. write it off).
- After the assessment, the insurer will require three quotations from either 3 panel beaters (in the case of repair) or 3 car dealers (in the case of write-off).
	- The quotations are submitted to the insurer who will then decide on the service provider.
#### CAR INSURANCE: TIPS
Considerations when choosing a car insurance policy:
- Shop around for a deal that best suit your requirements.
- Consider increasing your excess so as to reduce your premiums.
- Take steps to reduce you risk exposure (e.g., by installing security devices).
- Match your risks with appropriate cover. The more expensive comprehensive policy may not always be necessary.
- Where premiums are linked to mileage, consider carpooling.
- Ensure that your policy is frequently updated to cover additional accessories (e.g. mag wheels).
### DEATH AND DISABILITY POLICIES.
- In a life insurance policy, the insurer agrees to pay a sum of money either:
	- To the nominated beneficiary upon the death of the insured; or
	- To the insured in the case of disability due to injury or illness.
- Life insurance policy may be either without profit or with profit.
- Without profit policies offer pure life insurance and provide for a lump-sum payment when the terms of the contract are fulfilled.
- With profit policies provide for a saving element as part of the policy – “universal life policies” are the only SA examples.
- There are three forms of without profit life insurance policies:
	- Term life insurance.
	- Credit life insurance.
	- Whole life insurance.
- The popularity of without profit life policies has diminished as insurers move towards with profit insurance policies.
#### DEATH AND DISABILITY POLICIES: Without Profit Policies.
###### Term Life Insurance:
- Provides life cover for a specified number of years after which a new contract would have to be signed if needed.
- This form of life insurance has decreased in popularity in favour of whole life and universal life insurance policies.
###### Credit Life Insurance:
- Is a term insurance that provides life cover for one or more outstanding debts of the insured.
- The premiums you pay decreases over-time in line with the diminishing amount of the debt.
###### Whole Life Insurance:
- This is a permanent life insurance that provides cover over the full life of the insured.
- Premiums are higher than for the term life insurance policies. 20
### DEATH AND DISABILITY POLICIES: With Profit Policies.
###### Universal Life Insurance Policies:
- This is a permanent life cover that has two components, namely:
	- A life cover element (that may include disability & dreaded disease cover).
	- A savings element, which earns monthly interest at a rate determined by the insurer. The savings element reduces the amount of premiums.
###### Disability Cover:
- Is packaged with life insurance and provides cover against loss of work or income due to disability arising from injury or illness.
- This cover distinguishes between impairment (diminished capacity to work or earn income) and disability (inability to work).
- SA insurers provide for three forms of disability cover: Own occupational disability, occupational disability & total disability.
- Own Occupational Disability:
	- Pays benefits if you are unable to work in your current profession or similar/related occupation: as a lump-sum or monthly until retirement.
###### Dreaded Disease Cover:
- This is also known as “critical illness cover”.
- Provides cover against any major illness (heart attacks, stroke or cancer) which may result in financial difficulties or diminished quality of life.
- This cover is a form of “named perils insurance”.
- Benefits are paid (as a lump-sum) on diagnosis of any of the diseases named in the contract.
- Premiums are higher than for death and disability cover and may increase further if there is evidence of:
	- High-risk lifestyle (e.g. smoking, drinking etc.).
	- History of critical illness in the family.
### DEATH AND DISABILITY POLICIES: TIPS.
###### Considerations When Taking Out a Death and Disability Cover:
- Shop around for a deal that best suit your requirements.
- Is there a discount for purchasing multiple insurance policies from the same insurer?
- Change your lifestyle – quit smoking and/or join a gym.
- Do not fail to take a life cover because it is expensive – the terms are very flexible (some cover is better than no cover).
- Your family history is a good indicator of the need for a dreaded disease cover.
- Given a waiting period before benefits are paid, it is important to establish the length of this waiting period.
### MEDICAL COVER.
- Medical costs are typically covered by medical schemes which receive premiums in exchange for the provision of health care services to the principle member and his/her dependents.
- Medical schemes may either be:
	- Open scheme: obliged to admit any individual who apply for membership.
	- Restricted Scheme: Where membership is restricted to specified individuals.
###### Late Joiner Penalties:
- These penalties are charged on new members who join a scheme when they are old (35 years or older).
- These penalties increase the premiums you pay.
- The penalties are designed to protect existing scheme members from individuals who join a scheme when they are old and in need of medical cover.
###### Waiting Periods:
- Because some schemes impose waiting periods, it is important to establish whether a waiting period applies.
- This is meant to protect the scheme against the practice of anti-selection – where an individual joins a scheme after realizing that he/she wants to enjoy the benefits immediately (to the disadvantage of existing members).
- A scheme may impose a general 3-month waiting period (before claiming benefits) or a 12-month condition-specific waiting period.
- Where the employer changes or terminates a scheme used by the company, a waiting period cannot be imposed on the employees.
###### Benefits Covered:
- Medical schemes provide a wide range of benefits, from comprehensive to limited forms of cover (e.g. hospital plans).
- Comprehensive plans provide unlimited hospital cover and comprehensive day-to-day benefits (may have an annual limit).
- Hospital plans cover major medical and hospital costs but not day-to-day medical expenses.
###### Settling Claims:
- Schemes only pay claims for services provided by a registered provider and for benefits a member is entitled to receive.
- Members may claim for accounts still outstanding or for accounts paid (reimbursement). Claims must be received within four months of receiving the service – hence must be submitted timeously.
### MEDICAL AID COVER: TIPS.
###### Considerations When Choosing a Medical Scheme:
- Bigger schemes are often better – given better cross-subsidization of premiums, economies of scale, and lower premiums.
- Ensure that the scheme maintains its solvency above the required threshold.
- Determine your needs based on your medical history.
- Match your needs to the benefits offered by your shortlist of medical schemes.
