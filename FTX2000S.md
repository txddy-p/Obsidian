# Personal Finance

## What is personal finance
- Business 
	- Planning, directing, monitoring, organising and controlling of the monetary resources of an organisation
	- Sound management of finances of an organisation in order to achieve financial objectives
- Individual 
	- Planing, directing, monitoring, organising and controlling of personal monetary resources to maximise wealth or minimise loss of wealth
	- Management of personal finances in order to achieve personal financial objectives(short, medium & long term)

## Factors influencing Personal Financial Plan
- Your Goals (yourself & family, short, medium & long terms)
- Your Values (Influenced by tradition, culture, religion)
- Your Personal choices (Prioritise what is important)
- Any Major event that took place in your life
- Your needs (wants Vs needs)
- Your Present and Future life-cycle conditions

## Life cycle conditions

# Personal Financial Life Cycle
![[Pasted image 20230730154046.png]]

#### Stage 1 – The dependent stage
During these first two or so decades of life, the individual is nearly completely dependent on others (typically parents) for his or her financial needs, and has very few financial responsibilities or decision-making opportunities.
#### Stage 2 – The single stage
Here, the individual starts earning his or her own income, but this typically does not exceed expenses by much. As a result, the financial emphasis is short term and there is not much scope for saving. Credit management, budgeting and financial discipline are relevant to this stage.
#### Stage 3 – The paired stage
The individual is now no longer alone and starts to share financial responsibilities with a partner or spouse. Financial management is now complicated by the responsibilities towards the partner, but at the same time some expenditure (such as accommodation) can now be shared. This stage is often where it first becomes possible to start saving for the future.
#### Stage 4 – The family stage
General and financial priorities change when children arrive on the scene. It now becomes more difficult to take financial risk, and income growth may not keep up with new expenses such as education, medical expenses, groceries and children’s clothing.
#### Stage 5 – The post-family stage
This stage commences once there are no longer children in the house. Typically, the reduction in expenses as children leave the house and enter their independent stage coincides with the income of the household nearing its maximum. This allows for increased savings and investment, and with retirement approaching, retirement planning becomes the main financial focus.
#### Stage 6 – The retirement stage
For the first time since the dependent stage, no income is now generated through active employment. The only sources of income are now returns on investments previously made. All expenses therefore have to be met from savings and returns on investments. Estate planning becomes important, and medical expenses are often a big financial concern.

An alternative way to view the financial life cycle is to consider it in terms of the dominant financial priorities at any given stage. On this basis, the following three phases can be identified:
###### Phase 1 – Accumulation (corresponds to stages 2 to 4 above). 
During this stage, the individual or households is still building up wealth, and there is less focus on financial risk.
###### Phase 2 – Consolidation (corresponds to stages 4 and 5 above).
While wealth may still be growing, there is now also an increasing emphasis on protecting this wealth against loss. Risk protection (e.g. insurance) and investment planning become a major consideration.
###### Phase 3 – Preservation (corresponds to stage 6 above). 
There is no longer any new wealth being generated by the individual or household. An increase in wealth is now only possible through the appreciation in value of existing assets or the generation of income from these assets (for example, the increase in value of shares, or interest earned on savings). However, should these assets decrease in value the retired person is not in a position to replace them with new wealth generated through work-related efforts. As a result, during this stage the key consideration is to preserve existing wealth, which is now the only source of further wealth generation and, indeed, of survival.

# Risk Return Relationship of Investments
The degree of uncertainty as to whether a decision will work out as expected. Good risk refers to a more favourable outcome than expected and conversely bad risk.
The greater the risk the greater the reward
- Risk averse 
	- seeking to avoid risk.
	- risk aversion is described by investopedia as the tendency to avoid risk and have a low risk tolerance
- The more Risk Averse investor demands significantly higher expected returns per unit of risk.
![[Pasted image 20230730155514.png]]
- Speculator
	- Assumes “considerable risk” in order to obtain “commensurate gain” (positive risk premium).
- Risk Averse Investor
	- A risk averse investor is not that different to a speculator…both seek a level of return commensurate with the risk they are prepared to accept.
- Gamble
	- Bet or wager on an uncertain outcome - favourable

- Risk averse investors are willing to consider only risk-free prospects or speculative prospects with positive risk premiums
- Investments with higher expected returns and lower risk are considered more attractive and will therefore be ranked higher in terms of preference. Not Ponzi schemes
- Beware of investments with fantastic returns and low risk
- Examples of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency fraud in the news lately (R9B, R51B)
- If faced with investments of equal return, the risk averse investor will choose the investment with the lower risk…conversely…..
## What determines the level of Risk Aversion
![[Pasted image 20230730171402.png]]
The risk-return trade-off is tied to the individual's circumstances and where they are in the financial life cycle. These are a few factors that an individual’s ability and desire to take financial risk depends on:
- `Personality`: Some people are naturally more inclined to take risks than others.
- `Financial resources`: The wealthier you are, the more you can afford to take financial risks, as your wealth gives you a safety net if something goes wrong. At the opposite end of the spectrum, it is also true that those with very little often take financial risk as they have very little to lose. A good example of this is a person playing the lottery with the little bit of money that he has, as the near-certain loss may be considered small in return for the potential reward.
- `Age`: The older a person is, the less time he or she has to recover from financial setbacks. Therefore, older people tend to be less likely to take financial risk than younger people (in other words, they are more risk averse).
- `Dependants`: It is far easier to take risk if you know that failure will only affect you. It is usually more difficult to take financial risk once there are dependants such as children involved, especially if they will suffer financially or from loss of opportunity if financial risk taking leads to a bad outcome.
- `Skills and abilities`: Here the focus is again on the ability to recover if a risk-taking venture or investment does not work out. A person who has highly sought-after skills will, for example, find it easier to resign from a paying job to start their own business than someone who thinks that they will not be able to find employment again should the venture fail.
- `Support and back-up`: If there is an extended or wealthy family, or a spouse with a second income to fall back on in case things go wrong, it is naturally easier to take financial risk.
# Setting Financial Goals
Deciding on financial goals (the destination), allows you to plan the financial route to get there, and to start managing your finances in a way that maximises the chances of you achieving your dreams. Effective financial goal setting typically consists of the following steps:
- `Identify financial goals`: Financial goals are derived from non-financial objectives. The first step is to make a list of all dreams and aspirations that require money to be realised. These need to be stated in financial terms. 
- `Prioritise financial goals`: You probably have far more dreams that you can ever hope to afford. You must be clear about which are realistic and, of those, which are most important to you. This requires prioritising financial goals. It is important to realise that there is often a trade-off, meaning that in order to achieve some big financial goals, it may be necessary to sacrifice many small ones, and vice versa.
- `Categorise financial goals`: The third step is to separate financial goals into short, medium and long-term goals. These three groups usually require very different financial strategies, and progress towards achieving them will most likely be assessed differently. As a rough guideline, we can think of short-term as being one year or less, medium-term as between one and five years, and long-term more than five years.
- `Estimate costs and saving requirements`: In order to have a financial plan for achieving each goal, it is first necessary to determine roughly how much that goal will cost, which is another way of asking how much needs to be saved in order to achieve each goal. In some cases, this is easy, like determining the deposit on a new car or finding out what a trip to Europe would cost. It is far more difficult to estimate what financial security in retirement will require, or what education will cost for children who have just been born, for example. This illustrates the link between steps 3 and 4; that shorter-term goals are far easier to quantify than longer-term ones, but then again we have more time to achieve the longer-term goals and adjust our strategies for this as time passes.
- Design appropriate savings plans: Once you have an idea of how much has to be saved by when, it becomes possible to design a savings plan. This plan needs to be incorporated into the Budgeting process, which we will be discussing later in this module.
- Monitor and update: In order to maximise the chances of achieving a financial goal, it is important to monitor your progress towards that goal regularly, and to update and adjust the plan to get there if required. For example, two years after you start saving for a trip to Disneyworld, you may find that the rand is much weaker against the dollar than before, and that the trip is now 30% more expensive than originally anticipated. Clearly, this will require a reassessment of the savings strategy that is required. The shorter-term a financial goal is, the more often progress towards it has to be monitored.
Some common errors in financial goal setting include the following:
- The financial goals that are set are not well defined or quantified (for example: “I want to live well one day.”). It is far better to set specific goals that can form the objectives of clear financial plans.
- Financial goals are set that are overambitious or unachievable. There is no point in pursuing something that is unrealistic. All you will achieve is frustration and, even worse, you may lose out on financial goals that would have been attainable.
- Financial goals and plans often do not take into account changing (usually increasing) prices, and are not designed with this in mind. The longer the time horizon of the goal, the bigger this problem becomes. Clearly, if a newly employed person decides to save for a deposit on a flat that he or she wants to buy in five years’ time, the savings plan cannot be designed so that it will provide only enough cash after five years to put down a deposit based on today’s prices. We will discuss this in more detail in module 2

### Why are goals not met?
– Not regularly monitored
– No milestones set
– Not regularly updated or evaluated
– Not financed (no saving or saving plan)
– Inflexible
– Not aware (conscious) of the goals set?

# Personal Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet)
![[equity.png]]
- Your personal Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) is best described as a "SNAPSHOT" of your financial position at a point (a moment or an instant) in time.
- Your Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) will consist of
	- Assets (`resources owned outright or bought with borrowed money`)
	- Liabilities (`money owed to outsiders such as banks, stores, credit cards`)
	- Equity ($\text{NET WORTH} = \text{Assets less }\text{Liabilities}$)
- It is best to reflect values at Fair (market) value…e.g. you may have bought a house for R100K but bit is now worth R500K. You should record the Fair value on your personal Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) at R500K.
- What are the benefits of reflecting the assets at Fair value? - `It provides a more reliable assesment of financial postion`
## Assets
- Assets are resources you either control or own.
- They represent that which you have invested in over the years, they can be Tangible (physical) (house, car etc.) or Financial assets (shares, bonds, unit trusts etc.).
- They have and provide current and Future Economic Value and Benefits (FEB).
- Assets also include costs paid in advance that have not yet expired (been used) e.g. Prepaid rent
## Liabilities
- Liabilities are Financial obligations that you may have (or incurred). i.e. monies you owe to creditors from a past transaction involving the credit purchase of goods or services or money borrowed from the bank.
- What is Repo Rate and Prime rate (explain & percentage)
	- `Repo Rate` - rate at which SARB lends money to commercial banks
	- `Prime Rate` - rate at which Commercial banks lend to customers usually higher than `Repo rate`
- Liabilities can be seen as a legal monetary claim against your assets. Remember Creditors & Banks want money not used assets or assets that have low or no resale value.
- Liabilities includes cash amounts received in advance for future services.
- (From store POV - Gift cards, Individual Annual gym subscription)
## Owner’s Equity
- Owner's equity may also be referred to as the value of YOUR ASSETS MINUS YOUR LIABILITIES. This is effectively what you are worth (we refer to this as your EQUITY/NET WORTH/NET ASSET VALUE).
$$\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Owner's Equity}$$
![[owners_equity.png]]
![[eg_balance_sheet.png]]
## Cash Flow
- The Cash flow statement provides information about a your gross CASH RECEIPTS (income) and gross CASH PAYMENTS for a specified period of time (usually a month or year) 
- Gross Cash receipts (Income) – Gross cash payments (Expenses) = Cash Surplus
	- $\text{Income} - \text{Expenses} = \text{Cash Surplus}$

| Consumption | Investment | Saving |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spoil yourself and decrease your net worth |  Increase your net worth |  Increase your net worth |
- `Consumption`:  As this does not affect the wealth of the family, it does not have any impact on the balance sheet.
- `Investment`: The excess cash can instead be used to buy additional assets without adding more debt, thereby improving the Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet).
- `Saving`: It is also possible to save the excess money instead of spending it. This is just another form of investment that increases assets, thereby improving the Statement of Financial Position (Balance sheet) (wealth) of the family.
## What is a budget? Why Budget?
### Definition
- A budget is a `detailed itemised monetary summary` of ESTIMATED INCOME AND EXPENSES for a given FUTURE period.
- The estimation of future income and expenses, and the allocation of this income to expenses, savings or investment, and the repayment of debt. 
- In contrast to the setting of financial objectives, budgeting is usually a more short-term process. Budgeting is typically done on a monthly basis, although annual budgeting can also be useful.

### Some of the benefits of regular and disciplined household budgeting are that it:
- `Reveals the full picture`: Helps identify wasteful expenditure. Budgeting forces you to identify all your expenses and incomes in detail. Only by linking these items together in a comprehensive budget do you get a full picture of your monthly (or annual) income, expenses and cash flows.
- `Allows for control`: Managing income & expenses more efficiently. By revealing the full financial picture and identifying all expenses, income and so on, the budgeting process makes it possible for the individual or household to start taking control of the financial environment and to start managing income and expenses in a more efficient and ultimately beneficial way.
- `Identifies potential savings`: Measuring all sources of income and expenses would highlight inefficient, unnecessary and redundant sources of expenditure. As the saying goes, “You cannot manage what you do not measure.” A budget allows you to plan, and then to measure against your plan. Once you start measuring all sources of income and expenses, it is often surprisingly easy to find inefficient, unnecessary and redundant sources of expenditure.
- `Leads to financial discipline`: Once there are guidelines and targets set in the budget (especially for expenses), it becomes much more difficult to spend recklessly and without reference to the bigger picture.
- Leads to strict financial discipline over time
- Adapt quickly as your financial situation changes
- Achieve your financial goals.
- Allows you to save too

### Budgeting Steps
###### Step 1 – Collect information
Firstly it's necessary to identify both income and expenses. Quantification is next and the more accurate the estimate the more the value in budgeting.
###### Step 2 – Identify and list all sources of income
List all sources of income whether regular or irregular. The timing and amounts of some of these incomes may be difficult to predict but at this stage it's only necessary to list them.
###### Step 3 – Identify and list all expenses
Just like incomes list all possible sources of expenses. Some expenses are unforeseen so it's good practise to list as many sources as one can think of. 
###### Step 4 – Classify and Prioritise expenses
Each expense item can be classified as either a Fixed or a Variable expense.  It is useful to make this distinction, as it is usually difficult to change fixed expenses, while variable expenses can often be adjusted if needed.
###### Step 5 – Construct the budget
The use of spreadsheet software is recommended for this step, which involves adding up the sources of income and the expenses, roughly in the format of the cash-flow statement, but typically with far more items. It is useful to include a column that restates all expenses as a percentage of total income in the budget , as this makes comparison and interpretation easier.
###### Step 6 – Balance and adjust the budget
The final outcome of the budgeting process  is either a cash surplus or a cash deficit, similar to the outcome of the cash-flow statement. However, if this outcome is not acceptable for whatever reason , it becomes necessary to go back to the various income and expense items (most often more the latter), and to adjust some of these realistically so that the final outcome is acceptable. The key is to make realistic and achievable adjustments to budget items, rather than simply ones based on wishful thinking.
###### Step 7 – Keep ongoing records
It is essential to keep records of all expenses and income (salary slips, receipts, bank statements, tax documentation and so on), and to capture these in the same format as the budget on an ongoing basis. This allows for measurement, which is the next step.
###### Step 8 – Measure outcomes and review the budget
At the end of the budgeting period, the budget should be reviewed, ideally on a monthly basis. For each category or line item captured in step 7 above, the actual outcome (what actually happened during the month), should be compared to the original budget for that category or line item. Because it is highly unlikely that all expenses will have been perfectly predicted, there will be many items that will have been either below or above the amounts budgeted for. Where these differences are big (positive or negative) the causes should be investigated to see if this is likely to recur. If so, the budget for the following month should be adjusted to take this new learning into account. In this way, the predictive accuracy of a budget will improve over time as it continuously incorporates new learning. One very useful and practical skill to
acquire is Financial Discipline.
###### Step 9 – Repeat the process for the next period
After having compared the actual incomes and expenses for the month with the budget set at the beginning of the month, a new budget needs to be set for the next month. As mentioned above, this budget will incorporate all lessons learned from the previous months. Individual or household financial budgeting is an ongoing process.
